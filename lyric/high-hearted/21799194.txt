Whistle For The Choir
 作曲  John Lawler & Gordon McRory & Barry Wallace

Well it's a big big city and it's always the same
Can never be too pretty tell me your name
Is it out of line if I were  simply bold to say
"Would you be mine"?

Because I may be a beggar and you maybe the queen

I know I maybe on a downer am still ready to dream
Now it's  o'clock，the time is just the time it takes for you to talk

So if you're lonely why'd you say your not lonely

Oh your a silly girl' I know I hurt it so

It's just like you to come

And go you know me no you don't even know me

Your so sweet to try' oh my' you caught my eye
A girl like you is just irresistible

Well it's a big big city and the lights are all out
But it's much as I can do you know to figure you out
And I must confess' my hearts in broken pieces
And my heads a mess

And it's  in the morning' and I'm walking along

Beside the ghost of every drinker
here who has ever done wrong

And it's you' woo hoo
That's got me going crazy for the things you do

So if your crazy I don't care you amaze me

Oh your a stupid girl' oh me' oh my' you talk

I die' you smile' you laugh' I cry

And only' a girl like you could be lonely

And it's a crying shame' if you would think the same

A boy like me's just irresistible
So if your lonely' why'd you say you're not lonely

Oh your a silly girl' I know I hurt it so

It's just like you to come and go

And know me' no you don't even know me

Your so sweet to try oh my' you caught my eye

A girl like you's just irresistible
