by初夏的微笑
If I talked to you
You are a super fool to me
That I can't imagine every thing you do make me happy
If you talked to me
I am the smartest fool to you
Just like the worm that gets up early then meets a hungry bird
Have I talked to you the prettiest part of you
You have an honesty
A bubbly face
And a thoughtful heart
Do I fall in love with this kind of you
I wanna say right now
Thousand times of Yes I do
If I talked to you
You are a super fool to me
That I can't imagine every thing you do make me happy
If you talked to me
I am the smartest fool to you
Just like the worm that gets up early then meets a hungry bird

Have I talked to you the prettiest part of you
You have an honesty
A bubbly face
And a thoughtful heart
Do I fall in love with this kind of you
I wanna say right now
Thousand times of Yes I do
If I talked to you
You are a super fool to me
That I can't imagine every thing you do make me happy
If you talked to me
I am the smartest fool to you
Just like the worm that gets up early then meets a hungry bird
Gets up early then meets a hungry bird
Gets up early then meets a hungry bird
