Do do do do do
Today I'm laughing the clouds away
I hear what the flowers say
Drinking a drop of rain
And i see places that i have been
in ways that I've never seen
My starters(not sure) The grass is green
Oh can't believe it it's so simple
feels so natural to me
If this is love love is easy it's the easiest thing to do
If this is love love completes me cos I feel like i been missing you
A Simple equation with no complications to leave you confused
If this is love love love it's the easiest to do
Do do do do do
Feel the way that i do
Do i turn the grey skies blue
And make dirty streets look new
and the birds sing
Twi heeheehee--heeheehee twi le di di di di
Now i know exactly what they need
Can't believe it feels so simple
Feels so natural to me
If this is love love is easy it's the easiest thing to do
If this is love love completes me cos I feel like i been missing you
A Simple equation with no complications to leave you confused
If this is love love love
it's the easiest to do
Do do do do do
If this is love love is easy it's the easiest thing to do
If this is love love completes me
cos I feel like i been missing you
A Simple equation with no complications to leave you confused
If this is love love love it's the easiest to do
Do do do do do
