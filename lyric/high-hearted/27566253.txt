Devil in my hand
The Dentals
In the sand at Tonnys corporal beach
Eating ice cream and listening to your preach
Whether an my survivals great
And I’m sitting here drinking a light beer
Difference scene now I’m in the snow
Rocky Mountains are they are such a blow
It’s cozy with a fireplace
And I am sitting here drinking a like beer
On a cruise all the food is free
I am at the pool guess who is next to me?
It’s Jennifer she a cheerleader
And I am sitting here drinking a light beer
I can’t believe I am right here
I can’t believe I drinking a light beer
Why do I hold this drink in my hand?
I can’t believe I am right here
I can’t believe I drinking a light beer
My luck that it’s only a nightmare
I wake up the live beats gone away
But sadly Jennifer is away too
I guess both things where Too good to be true
And I am ok with that
Yes I am
