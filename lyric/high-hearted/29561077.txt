Look at what you've done
Stand still fallin' away from me
When it takes so long
Fire's out what do you want to be?
I'm holdidn' on
Myself was never enough for me
Gotta be so strong
There's a power in what you do
Now every other day I'll be watching you
Oh-oh Oh-oh
Show you what it feels like
Now Ivm on the outside
Oh-oh
We did everything right now I'm on the outside
Oh-oh
Show you what it feels like
Now I'm on the outside
Oh-oh
We did everything right now I'm on the outside
Though you give me no reason
For me to stay close to you
Tell me what lovers do
How are we still breathing?
It's never for us to choose
I'll be the strength in you
I'm holdidn' on (I'm holdidn' on)
Myself was never enough for me
Gotta be so strong
There's a power in what you do
Now every other day I'll be watching you
Oh-oh Oh-oh
Show you what it feels like
Now I'm on the outside
Oh-oh
We did everything right now I'm on the outside
Oh-oh
Show you what it feels like
Now I'm on the outside
Oh-oh
We did everything right now I'm on the outside
I'll show you what it feels like
Now I'm on the outside (eeeey)
I'll show you what it feels like
Show you what it feels like
Now I'm on the outside
Oh-oh
We did everything right now I'm on the outside
