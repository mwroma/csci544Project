Long ago and far away
You took me to a place
I can’t forget
If You’re my knight in shining armour
Guess you just don’t realise it yet
I been cooped up in a tower
For hours and hours
But the wrong guys all try to rescue me
Why kiss another frog
You’re the only one I want
It’s obvious
Why can’t you see?
Wontcha take me to the place we used to meet
It’s sunny and funny
And quirky and oh oh oh
A little piece of heaven
And I so wanna go
I know my happy ending
But you don’t have a clue
Cause where I wanna be is a place
A place called you
Long ago and far away
In a land of make believe
I saw a perfect happy ending
So come on back and set me free
I been cooped up in a tower
For hours and hours
The wrong guys all try to rescue me
Why kiss another frog
You’re the only one I want
It’s obvious
Why can’t you see?
Wontcha take me to the place
We used to meet
It’s sunny and funny
And quirky and oh oh oh
A little piece of heaven
And I so wanna go
I know my happy ending
But you don’t have a clue
Cause where I wanna be is a place
A place called you
Take me to the place where the stars come out
Just you and me it’s what it’s all about
Take me to a place where we used go
Where you know let me love so Oh oh oh
Take me to the place where the stars come out
Just you and me it’s what it’s all about
Take me to a place where we used go
Where you know let me love so Oh oh oh
It’s sunny and funny
And quirky and oh oh oh
A little piece of heaven
And I so wanna go
I know my happy ending
But you don’t have a clue
Cause where I wanna be is a place
A place called~  you
It’s sunny and funny
And quirky and oh oh oh
A little piece of heaven
And I so wanna go
I know my happy ending
But you don’t have a clue
How much I long to see your face
Cause no one can replace
A place called you~
