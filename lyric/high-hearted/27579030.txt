tiI Still Belong

you've been fire so far away
time flies by and so they say
you've been on the same page since we met
when you couldn't stand us stay up straight
you will feel the sand too late
you go out rumbling in the night
you give me starters and burnt
you leave me stars struck with no warns
and every moment you're gone
you know I still belong
you let me know that you’re the reason
you say Hello I say Goodbye
and you turn on my rose to write and I don’t know why
But I I still belong
I still belong
Yeah I still belong
You’ve been fire so far away
Will I ever see the day that
you won’t take the long way home
I’m pushing far
You’re holding back
I draw the outline to paint it black
Will I want it any other way
you give me starters and burnt
you leave me stars struck with no warns
and every moment you're gone
you know I still belong
you let me know that you’re the reason
you say Hello I say Goodbye
and you turn on my rose to write and I don’t know why
But I I still belong
I still belong
Yeah I still belong

It’s alright if you go slow
It’s alright to take your time
Cuz we belong together
You and I belong together
Good time for coming home
So don’t flash and burn we all know
that we belong together
you let me know that you’re the reason
you say Hello I say Goodbye
and you turn on my rose to write
and I don’t know why
But I I still belong
I still belong×

you turn on my rose to write
and I don’t know why
But I I still belong
