I'm hurting baby
I'm broken down
I need your loving loving
I need it now
When I'm without you
I'm something weak
You got me begging begging
I'm on my knees
I don't wanna be needing your love
I just wanna be deep in your love
And it's killing me when you're away
Ooh baby

where you are
I just wanna be there where you are
And I gotta get one little taste
Sugar
Yes please
Won't you come and put it down on me
Oh right here cause I need
Little love and little sympathy
Yeah you show me good loving
Make it alright
Need a little a sweetness in my life
Sugar
