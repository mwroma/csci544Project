Mr Parker I have to tell you
I have loved you for so long
and my heart is beating stronger about to come and down
And I don't think I can make it without you by my side
Stay with me or I may die

Now in the day ï¼Œbut towards the evening
My mind turns to you
Light a candle pull me closer to dance a song or two
Cause I don't think I can make it without you by my side
Stay with me or I may die

Mr Parker I must tell you
I have loved you for so long
My little heart is beating stronger Spur this dreamer on
Oh I don't think I can make it
To you that may be fine
Stay with me or I may die
or I may die
