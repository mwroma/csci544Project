My life is brilliant my love is pure
I saw an angel of that I'm sure
He's smiled at me on the subway he was with another girl
But I won't lose no sleep on that 'cause I've got a plan
You're beautiful you're beautiful
You're beautiful it's true
I saw your face in a crowded place
And I don't know what to do 'cause I'll never be with you
Yeah he caught my eye as I walked on by
He could see from my face that I was flying high
And I don't think that I'll see him again
But we shared a moment that will last till the end
You're beautiful you're beautiful
You're beautiful it's true
I saw your face in a crowded place
And I don't know what to do 'cause I'll never be with you
la la la la la~ la la la la la la~~~
You're beautiful you're beautiful
You're beautiful it's true
There must be an angel with a smile on her face
When she thought up that I should be with you
But it's time to face the truth I will never be with you
