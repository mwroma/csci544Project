byw起名真难
I went out to make some money 'cos I've got no shame
Pour a little poison onto my good name
Down to Carolina through the pouring rain
Pour a little poison onto my good name
Just pour a little poison onto my good name
Well the rain came down and it soaked my shoes
It's a whiney little English boy singing the blues
I got a head full up of problems that I ain't gonna fix
When I'm staring at the walls inside the Motel 
Then I'm storming into Georgia like a midnight train
Pour a little poison onto my good name
Maryland will never take me back again
Pour a little poison onto my good name
Just pour a little poison onto my good name
Well the rain keeps falling everywhere I go
I got nobody but the voices on my radio
I shake the dust off every little sleepy southern town
Then I'll be crying like a loser when the sun goes down
Well it's all that I can do to try and get home sane
Pour a little poison onto my good name
Tonight another dozen they'll be glad I came
Pour a little poison onto my good name
Just pour a little poison onto my good name
Well the rain came down and it soaked my shoes
It's a whiney little English boy singing the blues
I got a head full up of problems that I ain't gonna fix
When I'm staring at the walls inside the Motel 
I went out to make some money 'cos I've got no shame
Pour a little poison onto my good name
Down to Carolina through the pouring rain
Pour a little poison onto my good name
Just pour a little poison onto my good name
Just pour a little poison onto my good name
Just pour a little poison onto my good name
