You've been hiding it all for so long
They can’t see there’s a war going on
Because what you think of me
conflicts what you feel for me
Baby it's hard I know

I've been trying to stay on the low
Just to let you figure it out on your own
Your feelings are clear
but all your friends in your ear keep saying
That I'm no good for you

You're so perfect to me
Nothing's changed the way I feel at all
If I stay down you'll come around
Eventually

Used to say
It was only a matter of time
For your heart matters more than your mind
And you try to fight it and I don't know why
You didn't stand a chance
I'm convinced
From the moment I tasted your lips
All I needed was just one kiss
And you try to fight it I knew right there
You didn't stand a chance at all

Showed you all of the cards in my hand
So you know exactly where I stand
And you're like the glass frame
at the edge of the table
Just waiting to fall fall fall

Girl you're perfect to me
Nothing's changed the way I feel at all
If I stay down you'll come around
Eventually

I used to say
It was only a matter of time
For your heart matters more than your mind
And you try to fight it and I don't know why
You didn't stand a chance
I'm convinced
From the moment I tasted your lips
All I needed was just one kiss
You try to fight it I knew right there
You didn't stand a chance at all



Used to say
It was only a matter of time
For your heart matters more than your mind
And you try to fight it and I don't know why
You didn't stand a chance
I'm convinced
From the moment I tasted your lips
All I needed was just one kiss
And you try to fight it I knew right there
I didn't stand a chance at all
