Last season's jeans don't be fittin' no more
You fuss about how ya gained one pound or more
Cheeseburger fries and coke is what you eat
Oh make that coke diet please
You always say natural beauty is in
Then why's your face all covered up with foundation
I dial your number cause you said to call
But all I get is a busy tone
woo woo woo woo woo
Girl I admit I'm addicted to you yeah~
woo woo woo woo woo
I'm in love with everything you do
Whenever I'm feelin' down I won't tell ya
But somehow you know
Can't explain how I feel when I'm with you
You I can't let go
Even my momma can't change who I am but
You've changed me for sure
Can't explain how I feel 'bout ya baby
You I won't let go

Girl you complain 'bout losing weight
You always say dieting is something that you hate
You stress about working out at all
Then you should stop eating all those candy bars
You watch your soap operas all day long
And then you say that we never go out at all
All I can do is just wait on you
I'm still in love no matter what you do
woo woo woo woo woo
Girl I admit I'm addicted to you yeah
woo woo woo woo woo
I'm in love with everything you do
Whenever I'm feelin' down I won't tell ya
But somehow you know
Can't explain how I feel when I'm with you
You I can't let go
Even my momma can't change who I am but
You've changed me for sure
Can't explain how I feel 'bout ya baby
You I won't let go
Every day I wake up smiling with you next to me
Oh girl there's nowhere else I'd rather be
Every second every minute
Girl it's you I'm needing
I love you the way you are

Whenever I'm feelin' down I won't tell ya
But somehow you know
Can't explain how I feel when I'm with you
You I can't let go
Even my momma can't change who I am but
You've changed me for sure
Can't explain how I feel 'bout ya baby
You I won't let go
