January's pale tapestry
a sky away
a golden mile of colour turn
all summer burn and holiday
and when you smile and
I don't care
From I don't care to unaware
the road that takes you faraway
goes running out of Saturday

Riverside in wintertide
wash all away
on down the stream
through holy night and city light
to early grey
and when you dream
will I be there?
Will I be there?
and unaware
in words asteam that frozen air
could never bear
could never bear
But what you dream now
I don't care
From I don't care to unaware
the road that takes you faraway
goes running out of Saturday
farawy
and running out of Saturday
