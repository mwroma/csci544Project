Cause you're a sky
cause you're a sky full of stars
I'm gonna give you my heart
Cause you're a sky
cause you're a sky full of stars
Cause you light up the path
I don't care go on and tear me apart
I don't care if you do
Cause in a sky
cause in a sky full of stars
I think I saw you
Cause you're a sky
cause you're a sky full of stars
I want to die in your arms arms
Cause you get lighter the more it gets dark
I'm going to give you my heart
And I don't care
go on and tear me apart
And I don't care if you do
Cause in a sky
cause in a sky full of stars
I think I see you
I think I see you
Because you're a sky
you're a sky full of stars
Such a Heavenly view
You're such a Heavenly view
