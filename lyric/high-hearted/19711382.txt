New Soul
I'm a new soul
I came to this strange world hoping I could learn a bit about how to give and take
But since I came here
Felt the joy and the fear
Finding myself making every possible mistake
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
I'm a young soul in this very strange world
Hoping I could learn a bit about what is true and fake
But why all this hate?
Try to communicate
Finding trust and love is not always easy to make
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
This is a happy end
Cause'you don't understand
everything you have done
Why's everything so wrong
This is a happy end
Come and give me your hand
I'll take your far away
I'm a new soul
I came to this strange world hoping I could learn a bit about how to give and take
But since I came here felt the joy and the fear
Finding myself making every possible mistake
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
a new soul
in this very strange world
a new soul
in this very strange world
