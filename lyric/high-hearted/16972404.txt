I met her on the day of
New Year's
EveI was shopping for a wedding gift on Buena Vista Street
I swear I saw the fire in her eyes
The kind of girl you hear about but never see in real life
Everyone needs something everyone wants love
She’s lying in my bed in just her underwear
She’s laughing at the words I sayYeah
we’re kissing and we’re touching
Underneath the covers listening to my thinking
I hear her whispering I love you
Right before I fall asleep
A boy can dream dream dream
A boy can dream dream dream
A boy can dream dream dream
A boy can dream dream dream
Now I woke up on Sunday afternoon
I had to drive back I was hoping I would see her soon
It's something about the way she looked at me
She keeps playing in my head like a broken record on repeat
Everyone needs something everyone wants love
She’s lying in my bed in just her underwear
She’s laughing at the words I say
Yeah we’re kissing and we’re touching
Underneath the covers listening to my thinking
I hear her whispering I love you
Right before I fall asleep
A boy can dream dream dream
A boy can dream dream dream
A boy can dream dream dream
A boy can dream dream dream
If only I had a number
I know later on tonight
She’d be lying in my bed in just her underwear
She’s laughing at the words I say
Yeah we’re kissing and we’re touching
Underneath the covers listening to my thinking
I hear her whispering I love you
Right before I fall asleep
Yeah a boy can dream dream dream
Oh a boy can dream dream dream
Oh I met her on the day of
New Year's
Ever
