I’ve been aiming for the top
Just like a rocket taking off
You got me high I’m flying in a dream
Got me feeling like the one
And after everything you’ve done
Just let me take this little moment to say

That you’re so special to me
All that I want and need
You’re so special to me
And I want the world to see
So special special

See I always feel the rush
And I don’t tell you this enough
But you’re the one who makes me happy
You’re my future don’t deny it
From time to time I bid to ride it
But I guess what I am trying to say
Is you’re so special to me
All that I want and need
You’re so special to me
And I won’t the world to see
So special special
I know you know I know that you know that you’re so special
I know you know I know that you know that you’re so special
I know you know I know that you know that you’re so special
I know you know I know that you know
You’re so special to me
All that I want and need
You’re so special to me
And I won’t the world to see
You’re so special to me
All that I want and need
You’re so special to me
And I won’t the world to see
