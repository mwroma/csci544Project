You've Got My Heart-Audrianna Cole
Don't matter what you're saying
Don't matter what you do
My heart is yours for keeping
Do with it what you choose
And my hearts not yours for beating
Even though it beats for you
A mistake I'm not repeating
A mistake I'm not repeating no
I know I really got to let you go
But you baby you
You you got my heart
Woah yes you do
Don't keep loose or misplace it
Don't leave it all alone
Don't beat it or berate it
Just treat it as your own
And Even though it's broken through
I'm still gonna live with you
And what am I supposed to do
With a broken heart anyway
But you baby you
You You've got my heart
Woah yes you do
you ou ou ou every you ou ou ou you ou ou ou
You've got my heart
Woah yes you do
Woah yes you do
You've got my heart
Woah yes you do
Woah yes you do
You've got my heart
Woah yes you do
Woah yes you do
You've got my heart
I know I really got to go
But you baby you
You've got my heart
Woah yes you do
you ou ou ou every you ou ou ou you ou ou ou
You've got my heart
Woah yes you do
you ou ou ou every you ou ou ou you ou ou ou
You've got my heart
Woah yes you do
you ou ou ou every you ou ou ou you ou ou ou
You've got my heart
Woah yes you do
