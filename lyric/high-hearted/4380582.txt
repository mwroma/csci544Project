love in a box
It's easy to see how everything is loosely
Put into a box to describe how
Well it is working
But can you tell me
How did she knock me off of my feet
When she said hello
My name is beautiful
I said excuse me miss but it's time for me to hit the floor
And now this dancing has turned to falling
Words can't do justice to this girl I know

And It's those deep breaths that get me through the times
She's standing next to me
She's nothing short of lovely
Does she notice that I can't breathe
Everything around me is getting hazy
I'll loosen up my tie
No use in being shy
So take one petal at a time
And toss it to the ground
Closer now I'll touch your lips to mine
And feel how we have to hold our breath
To make sure we don't miss one moment tonight

Under this moonlight
I can see the mystery behind your eyes
With every taste girl well I delight in you
And yet this distance
That separates my hand from yours
Can only make me appreciate your heart
I adore you

So take one petal at a time
And toss it to the ground
Closer now I'll touch your lips to mine
And feel how we have to hold our breath
To make sure we don't miss one moment tonight
Quiet now she's fast asleep
And to my arm she's clinging
You're mine girl
And my heart is yours

So take one petal at a time
And toss it to the ground
Closer now I'll touch your lips to mine
And feel how we have to hold our breath
To make sure we don't miss one moment tonight
