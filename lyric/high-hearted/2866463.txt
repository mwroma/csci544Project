Screaming your name at the top of my lung
Doesn't make a change
But it makes me feel stronger
I'm finally ready to but may we were both wrong
It took me a while to realize it's gone and we're done
I'm ok now but I want you to stay away
I don't feel sad and I'm not going alone
Don't you worry any more
It's easier to leave then be left behind
You know
Now I'm ok  but I want you away
At first I thought it was just about a dream
But chain of words leading to a dead end end
I sharpen my eyes to make you believe I 'll survive
You did you good but you killed me inside~ide
I'm ok now but I want you to stay away
I don't feel sad and I'm not going alone
Don't you worry any more
It's easier to leave then be left behind
You know
Now I'm ok  but I want you away
Now I'm ok  but I want you away
