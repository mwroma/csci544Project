Your face your style your kiss your smile
All the puzzle pieces i've been missing
No man alive could walk on by
Won't even try it
'cause there's no resisting you
You've been a long time coming around
Thought i was lost but now i'm found
You're like the final piece of the jigsaw puzzle
I've been waiting for all my life
Baby you make it better
Now my cinderella's got the slipper that fits
And i know this is it
'cause this jigsaw sure looks right

To think that i could ever find
Anyone better baby who am i fooling?
I missed all the signs blew so much time
I only found you when i stopped looking
You've been a long time coming around
Thought i was lost but now i'm found
You're like the final piece of the jigsaw puzzle
I've been waiting for all my life
Baby you make it better
Now my cinderella's got the slipper that fits
And i know this is it
'cause this jigsaw sure looks right
And even though sunshine fades
There's nobody could ever take your place
You're like the final piece of the jigsaw puzzle
I've been waiting for all my life
Baby you make it better
Now my cinderella's got the slipper that fits
And i know this is it
'cause this jigsaw sure looks right
