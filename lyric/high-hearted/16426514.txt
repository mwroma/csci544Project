Almost Lover
 作曲  Alison Sudol
 作词  Alison Sudol
Your fingertips across my skin
The palm trees swaying in the wind images
You sang me Spanish lullabies
The sweetest sadness in your eyes
Clever trick
Well I never want to see you unhappy
I thought you want the same for me
Goodbye my almost lover
Goodbye my hopeless dream
I'm trying not to think about you
Can't you just let me be?
So long my luckless romance
My back is turned on you
Should've known you'd bring me heartache
Almost lovers always do
We walked along a crowded street
You took my hand and danced with me
In the shade
And when you left you kissed my lips
You told me you would never never forget
These images
No
Well I never want to see you unhappy
I thought you want the same for me
Goodbye my almost lover
Goodbye my hopeless dream
I'm trying not to think about you
Can't you just let me be?
So long my luckless romance
My back is turned on you
Should've known you bring me heartache
Almost lovers always do
I cannot go to the ocean
I cannot drive the streets at night
I cannot wake up in the morning
Without you on my mind
So you're gone and I'm haunted
And I bet you are just fine
Did I make it that
Easy to walk right in and out
Of my life?
Goodbye my almost lover
Goodbye my hopeless dream
I'm trying not to think about you
Can't you just let me be?
So long my luckless romance
My back is turned on you
Should have known you bring me heartache
Almost lovers always do
