 There was a garden there was a man
 He was so lonely but God had a plan
 God had a plan
 He fell asleep but never could dream
 Hed wake up to the most beautiful thing
 Hed ever seen
 But there she was and there you are
 (Woah oh oh oh)
 What a mystery
 (Woah oh oh oh)
 Somehow you and me
 Are a picture of a greater love
 That someday we will see
 (Woah oh oh oh)
 Oh what a mystery
 The good Lord is working to make my heart new
 And I am more like Him when Im with you
 When Im with you
 Oh you are so patient
 you are so kind
 You are my favorite way
 that God shows His light in my life
 (Woah oh oh oh)
 What a mystery
 (Woah oh oh oh)
 Somehow you and me
 Are a picture of a greater love
 That someday we will see
 (Woah oh oh oh)
 Yeah what a mystery
 And day by day well chip away
 All the things that dont belong
 Every shadow every wrong
 Until we find deep down inside
 The glory we forgot the image of our God
 (Woah oh oh oh)
 What a mystery
 (Woah oh oh oh)
 Yea somehow you and me
 Are a picture of a greater love
 That someday we will see
 (Woah oh oh oh)
 Oh what a mystery
