Young and Divine - Fuck Up California
Yo Pezzywhy we sitting first class on this plane
We're going to California
Ohohwe gonna get them
Fucked up
Fuck up California
Let them know I'm from New York
Where the bars don't close till four
And we don't stop till we hit the floor
Blow up San Francisco teach them LA girls to disco
Bounce like Carmen Sandiego
Then we fly back when they want some more
Heyoutta JFK
Gonna fly all day
Pregaming on the airplane
Saylet's get to popping the champagne
What up rick James
Tell me about the dope game
Nowwe're gonna touch down
Went through the clouds to rocking on the ground
Better tell this town we'll be sleeping on the couch
So many shots that I think I'm gonna drown
Fuck up California
Let them know I'm from New York
Where the bars don't close till four
And we don't stop till we hit the floor
Blow up San Francisco teach them LA girls to disco
Bounce like Carmen Sandiego
Then we fly back when they want some more
Twistand ya roll it up now
And you give it a little kiss and you pass it on down
Chicksyeah we throwing them in the mix
Ain't nothing that a little booty call can't fix
Now the bar's shut down
Grab a  ounce back to the house
Panties falling down and we go another round
So many shots yeah my mom would be proud
Fuck up California
Let them know I'm from New York
Where the bars don't close till four
And we don't stop till we hit the floor
Blow up San Francisco teach them LA girls to disco
Bounce like Carmen Sandiego
Then we fly back when they want some more
Now we all fucked up

Can't get found so we jumping out the house
So many shots that I think I'm gonna drown
