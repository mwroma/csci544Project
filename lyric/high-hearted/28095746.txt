Let's leave our worries behind
Open our minds step outside
The days brand new
Moon turns to the sun and says
"Take their dreams run ahead this worlds for you"
So take my hand and just come along with me
We've got no where to be
Just don't think twice and put your mind at ease
Let's play make believe Let's play make believe

Let's pretend we're king and queen
Cross the earth and sail the seas
For ever wrong
Build our castle in the sand
Wont worry if the tide comes in
Your hearts my home
So take my hand and just come along with me
We've got no where to be
Just don't think twice and put your mind at ease
Let's play make believe let's play make believe

Standing still traveling fast
Not sure how long this will last
But it's alright
We've been to Beijing and back
And endings fine as long as that
Your by my side
So take my hand and just spend your life with me
It's our destiny
Just don't think twice And forever we will be
Together you and me let's play make believe

Just don't think twice and put your mind at ease
Let's play make believe let's play make believe
