This kicked in got your tongs in knots I see
Spit it out cuz im dying for company
I notice that you got it
You notice that I want it
You know that I can take it to the next level ba-by
If you want this good shit
Sicker than the remix
Baby let me blow your mind tonight
I cant take it take it take no more
Never felt like felt like this before
C’mon get me get me off the floor
DJ what you what you waitin' for
WOAH OH OH OH OH OH WOAH OH OH OH

Watch me move when I loose when I loose it hard
Get you off with the touch dancing in the dark
You notice what im wearing
I notice that you are staring
You know that I can take it to the next level baby
Harder than the A-list
Next one on my hit list
Baby let me blow your mind tonight
I cant take it take it take no more
Never felt like felt like this before
C’mon get me get me off the floor
DJ what you what you waitin’ for
WOAH OH OH OH OH OH WOAH OH OH OH
music~
See the sunlight
We aint stoppin’
Keep on dancing till the world ends
If you feel it
let it happen
Keep on dancing till the world ends
Keep on dancing till the world ends
Keep on dancing till the world ends
music~
WOAH OH OH OH OH OH WOAH OH OH OH

See the sunlight
We aint stoppin’
Keep on dancing till the world ends
If you feel it let it happen
Keep on dancing till the world ends
