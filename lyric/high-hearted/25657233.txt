 作词  Bruno Mars/Philip Lawrence/Ari Levine/Phredley Brown
Give me all give me all give me all your attention baby
I got to tell you a little something about yourself
You're wonderful flawless ooh you're a sexy lady
But you walk around here like you wanna be someone else
I know that you dont know it but you're fine so fine
Oh girl im gonna show you when you're mine oh mine
Treasure that means what you are
Honey you're my golden star
I know you can make my wish come true
If you let me treasure you
If you let me treasure you
Pretty girl pretty girl pretty girl you should be smiling
A girl like you should never live so blue
You're everything I see in my dreams
I would say that to you if it wasnt true
I know that you dont know it but you're fine so fine
Oh girl im gonna show you when you're mine oh mine
Treasure that means what you are
Honey you're my golden star
I know you can make my wish come true
If you let me treasure you
If you let me treasure you
You are my treasure you are my treasure
You are my treasure yeah you you you you are
You are my treasure you are my treasure
You are my treasure yeah you you you you are
Treasure that means what you are
Honey you're my golden star
I know you can make my wish come true
If you let me treasure you
If you let me treasure you
