Unique
oh oh oh
I am happy to be sad
It’s funny when I am mad
I don’t really make sense
But I know that that’s not bad
I am lonely in a crowd
And I am quiet when it’s loud
No I don’t know what I want
But I will figure it all out
I like to move around to different beat
I’ll walk away then smile in my own street
And I don’t really mind when you are fake
Cuz I am me and that’s unique
I am living in my own world every day
I’m party by myself in my own way
Might look a little funny but that’s okay
Cuz I am me and that’s unique
oh oh oh
I am me and that’s unique
I love you when you're mean
I feel dirty when I’m clean
No I don’t really make sense
But I know that you know what I mean
I’m hungry late at night
And I’m tired when it’s light
I’ve got my imperfections but I know that that’s alright
I like to move around to different beat
I’ll walk away then smile in my own street
And I don’t really mind when you are fake
Cuz I am me and that’s unique
I am living in my own world every day
I’m party by myself in my own way
Might look a little funny but that’s okay
Cuz I am me and that’s unique
Why should I be like everybody?
It’s overrated being ordinary
oh oh oh
I am me and that’s unique
I like to move around to different beat
I’ll walk away then smile in my own street
And I don’t really mind when you are fake
Cuz I am me and that’s unique
I am living in my own world every day
I’m party by myself in my own way
Might look a little funny but that’s okay
Cuz I am me and that’s uniqueOh yea
oh oh oh
I am me and that’s unique
oh oh oh
I am me and that’s unique
