arRickey Martin

She's into superstition
Black cats and voodoo dolls
I feel a premonition
That girl's gonna make me fall
She's into new sensation
New kicks in the candlelight
She's got a new addiction
For every day and night
She'll make you take your clothes off
And go dancing in the rain!
She'll make you live her crazy life
But she'll take away your pain
Like a bullet to your brain
Upside inside out
She's livin la Vida loca
She'll push and pull you down
She's livin la Vida loca
Her lips are devil red
And her skin's the color mocha
She will wear you out
Livin la vida loca
Livin la vida loca
She's livin la vida loca

Wake up in New York City
In a funky cheap hotel
She took my heart
And she took my money
She must've slipped me a sleepin pill
She never drinks the water
Makes you order French Champagne

Once you've had a taste of her
You'll never be the same
Yeah she'll make you go insane
Upside inside out
She's livin la Vida loca
She'll push and pull you down
She's livin la Vida loca
Her lips are devil red
And her skin's the color mocha
She will wear you out
Livin la vida loca
Livin la vida loca
She's livin la vida loca

End
