I'm gonna wear my flip-flossing
I'm gonna play some flip-cupping
Rock a little bit of hip-hoping Haggard and Jagger
And throw a  on the court whole game
If I'm lucky yeah I might get laid
The way that it's going
the cake gon' be floating
All I wanna do today
is wear my favorite shades and get stoned
Work a little less play a little more
That's what this day is for
And all I wanna do is
lace my J's and lace some Jack in my Coke
Work on my lay back ain't nothing wrong
With getting my sun daze on
Getting my sun daze on
Girl you know you're the life of my party
You can stay and keep sippin' Bacardi
Stir it up as we turn on some Molly
If you want you can get on Harley
I sit you up on a kitchen sink
Stick the pain umbrella in your drain
They wat that we're feeling we gon' buy this evening
All I wanna do today
is wear my favorite shades and get stoned
Work a little less play a little more
That's what this day is for
And all I wanna do is
lace my J's and lace some Jack in my Coke
Work on my lay back ain't nothing wrong
With getting my sun daze on
getting my sun daze on
All I wanna do today
is wear my favorite shades and get stoned
Work a little less play a little more
That's what this day is for
And all I wanna do is
lace my J's and lace some Jack in my Coke
Work on my lay back ain't nothing wrong
With getting my sun daze on
getting my sun daze on
