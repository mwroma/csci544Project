Do you ever stop and wonder why
It's so damn hard finding Mr Right
I swear it's just a Disney life
You only need to find love once
Here's the thing guys are all the same
They love you and they leave you like
it's just a game
Did no one tell 'em that old saying
"You only need to find love once"
Imagine my reaction once
When you walked in the room
Once I found you was never gonna let you go
I didn't hesitate I couldn't wait
All the other guys just evaporated
Once I found you I couldn't help but let it show
It must be love cause my heart thumps
And I'm so glad I waited for once
So many times I got it wrong
One summer thought I'd found the one
A couple of weeks and he was gone
You only need to find love once
I guess we all make mistakes
Hide the hurt when your heart breaks
But don't forget when things aren't great
You only need to find love once
Imagine my reaction once
When you walked in the room
Once I found you was never gonna let you go
I didn't hesitate I couldn't wait
All the other guys just evaporated
Once I found you I couldn't help but let it show
It must be love cause my heart thumps
And I'm so glad I waited for once
For once
All those times I'm walking home at night
I'm wondering who I'm really waiting for
Just one look at you and I swear I knew for sure
I knew for sure
Once I found you was never gonna let you go
I didn't hesitate I couldn't wait
All the other guys just evaporated
Once I found you I couldn't help but let it show
It must be love cause my heart thumps
And I'm so glad I waited
Once I found you was never gonna let you go
I didn't hesitate I couldn't wait
All the other guys just evaporated
Once I found you I couldn't help but let it show
It must be love cause my heart thumps
And I'm so glad I waited for once
