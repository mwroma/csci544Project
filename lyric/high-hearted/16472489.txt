time bomb
From the get-go I knew this was hard to hold
Like a crash the whole thing spun out of control
Oh on a wire we were dancing
Two kids no consequences
Pull the trigger without thinking
There's only one way down this road
It was like a time bomb set it in motion
We knew that we're destined to explode
And if I had to pull you out of the wreckage
You know I'm never gonna let you go
We're like a time bomb
Gonna lose it let's defuse it
Baby we're like a time bomb
But I need it wouldn't have it
Any other way
Well there's no way out of this so let's stay in
Have a storm that comes that'll soak us to an end
Oh resistance is useless
Just two kids stupid and fearless
Like a bullet shooting a lesson
There's only one way down this road
It was like a time bomb set it in motion
We knew that we're destined to explode
And if I had to pull you out of the wreckage
You know I'm never gonna let you go
We're like a time bomb
Gonna lose it let's defuse it
Baby we're like a time bomb
But I need it wouldn't have it
Any other way
Got my heart in your hands
Like a time bomb ticking
It goes off we start again
If it breaks we fix it
Got your heart in my hands
Like a time bomb ticking
We should know better we won't let go
It was like a time bomb set it in motion
We knew that we're destined to explode
And if I had to pull you out of the wreckage
You know I'm never gonna let you let me go
We're like a time bomb
Gonna lose it let's defuse it
Baby we're like a time bomb
But I need it wouldn't have it
Any other way
