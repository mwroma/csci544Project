Everybody gets weak
When our broken hearts send us to our knees
And everyone of us grieves
And needs a helping hand back up on our feet

To just believe

I will walk with you through desert lands
I will lift you from the sinking sand
When you have no strength
Just hold my hand
I will stand I will stand by you
I will stand I will stand by you

When it's hard to just breathe

From doing all you can

Just to make ends meet
When you're lost in life's give-and-take yep
I will be there to help you find your way
Yeah we'll find our way
So I will walk with you through desert lands
I will lift you from the sinking sand
When you have no strength
Just hold my hand
I will stand I will stand by you
I will stand I will stand by you
We were meant to walk
This broken world together
In the days of pain
And in the stormy weather
Knowing this is not how it will be forever
I'll stand by you
We were meant to walk
This broken world together
In the days of pain
And in the stormy weather
Knowing this is not how it will be forever
I'll stand by you
I will walk with you through desert lands
I will lift you from the sinking sand
When you have no strength
Just hold my hand
I will stand I will stand by you
I will walk with you through desert lands
I will lift you from the sinking sand
When you have no strength
Just hold my hand
I will stand I will stand by you
I will stand I will stand by you
I will stand I will stand by you
