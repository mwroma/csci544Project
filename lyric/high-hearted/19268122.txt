YOU MAKE MY DAY
I'v have the feeling
Walking with the thunder clouds
to get the sky right over me
Too many things to do
and never really satisfied
a glass would be half empty not half full
When you smiled at me in the morning
I knew that everything would change
I'll take the sunshine take the rain
If I win or lose a game
I don't care cause you make my day
It can't be worse it can be smile
could be looks and drive a while
for any reason you make my day
Some need an angle
want him to change it all
then go on something waiting for the day
Well maybe I'm a lucky man
cause I don't really understand
how life can be a drag when there is you
So I wake up every morning
with the smile upon my face
I'll take the sunshine take the rain
If I win or lose a game
I don't care cause you make my day
It can't be worse it can be smile
could be looks and drive a while
for any reason you make my day
oh na na na na na na na na na na
you make my day
make me happy
so that I can
take the sunshine take the rain
If I win or lose a game
I don't care cause you make my day
It can't be worse it can be smile
could be looks and drive a while
for any reason you make my day
I'll take the sunshine take the rain
If I win or lose a game
I don't care cause you make my day
It can't be worse it can be smile
could be looks and drive a while
for any reason you make my day
