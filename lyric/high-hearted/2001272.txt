The leaves were raked at the end of Edmond Lake
For the teams to find the evidence of why
They had failed to rise and run out and hide
When they heard the voices calling from the flame trees

I could see if the lovers hadn’t been to the lake that day
They could have found a way
To escape to town and take the Greyhound
With the coins we found
We went into the morning light


Won’t you wait' won’t you ever hesitate?
In the leaves you rake at the end of Edmond Lake
You could find that trail of crumbs and details
Of a crime that made us shiver as we climbed back

I could tell how a rabbit and a spell
Could relieve our eyes of plastic apple pies
And the strings that held our covers in well
And the coins we found
We went into the morning light

The leaves were raked at the end of Edmond Lake
For the teams to find the evidence of why
They had failed to rise and run out and hide
When they heard the voices calling from the flame trees
