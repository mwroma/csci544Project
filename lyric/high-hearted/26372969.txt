I hear the alarm go off at 
Used to be I'd wanna call in sick
I always dreaded this time of day

But not anymore ’cause of you
Smiling you perfect you

Good morning beautiful

I know it’s gonna be a good morning beautiful
When you’re waking up with me
It’s gonna be a good morning beautiful
Lalalala lalalala

Lalalala lalalala

As I’m going through my day
Nothing can take this smile from face
Whether sunshine whether the rain

I can weather any weather with you
Smiling you perfect you babe

Good morning beautiful

I know it’s gonna be a good morning beautiful

When you’re waking up with me
It’s gonna be a good morning beautiful
This feeling
Like I’m dreaming
It’s a dream come true
When I wake up with you

Lalalala lalalala

Lalalala lalalala

Sometimes this world is such a crazy place
But all I need is just to see your face
Whether sunshine whether the rain

I can weather any weather with you
Smiling you perfect you babe

Good morning beautiful

I know it’s gonna be a good morning beautiful

When you’re waking up with me
It’s gonna be a good morning beautiful
This feeling
Like I’m dreaming
It’s a dream come true
When I wake up with you

Woah oh!

Woah oh!

Lalalala lalalala

Lalalala lalalala

Good morning beautiful

I know it’s gonna be a good morning beautiful

When you’re waking up with me
It’s gonna be a good morning beautiful
Lalalala lalalala

Good morning beautiful
Lalalala lalalala

Good morning beautiful
（I know it’s gonna I know it’s gonna be）
Good morning beautiful
