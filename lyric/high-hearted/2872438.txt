Forevermore
You could be my white knight
I could be your fairy tale
You could come and save me
But that is not the end

I will wear a white dress
And you will paint a sunset
Life will be a love fest
That’s how it all begins

Say say oh playmate
Come out and play with me
And bring your dollies three
Climb up my apple tree
Slide down my rainbow
Into my cellar door
And we’ll be jolly friends
Forever more

But the world can spin so madly
And love can hurt so badly
And stories end so sadly
But this is not the end

Cause you still have my heartache
And I still have your sweater
And things they will be better
Oh no but not today

Say say oh playmate
I cannot play with you
My dolly’s got the flue
Hoo hoo hoo hoo hoo hoo
Aint got no rainbow
Aint got no cellar door
But we’ll be jolly friends
Forever more

Say say oh playmate
Come out and play with me
And bring your dollies three
Climb up my apple tree
Slide down my rainbow
Into my cellar door
And we’ll be jolly friends
Forever more
