It`s a wild wild web when you feel lost inside
the wild wild web where there`s nothing to hide
on the wild wild web please tell me where I`ll find
virtual reality of your smile

It`s a changing world that we`re living today

If you need a girl there`s a very new way

You`re chatting all alone on the web
declaring all your love on the net
It`s a wild wild web when you feel lost inside
the wild wild web where there`s nothing to hide
on the wild wild web please tell me where I`ll find
virtual reality of your smile

From my bottom I prefer the old fashion way

When to flirt with a girl you just go for a date

but all I gotta view is your mail
so stay connected just don`t run away
It`s a wild wild web when you feel lost inside
the wild wild web where there`s nothing to hide
on the wild wild web please tell me where I`ll find
virtual reality of your smile

It`s a wild wild web when you feel lost inside
the wild wild web where there`s nothing to hide
on the wild wild web please tell me where I`ll find
virtual reality of your smile
Now I hope that some day we will be meeting for real

And we talk and we laugh having some Indian meal

I hope that good time at last
`cause Gs I found are most just too fast
It`s a wild wild web when you feel lost inside
the wild wild
