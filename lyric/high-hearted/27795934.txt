At break of day
In hope we rise
We speak your name
We lift our eyes
Tune our hearts
To Your beat
Where we walk
There You'll be
With fire in our eyes
Our lives a light
Your love untamed
It's blazing out
The streets will glow
Forever bright
Your glory is breaking through the night
You will never fade away
Your love is here to stay
By my side
In my life
Shining through me everyday
You will never fade away
Your love is here to stay
By my side
In my life
Shining through me everyday!

You wake within me wake within me
You're in my heart forever
You wake within me wake within me
You're in my heart forever!

With fire in our eyes
Our lives a light

You will never fade away
Your love is here to stay

In my life
Shining through me everyday
You will never fade away
