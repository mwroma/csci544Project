I’m a messenger and I travel light
Give me somewhere I can sleep tonight
Through the wind and the rain and the dark I ride
What I carry’s worth more than my life
I want you to hear the message I’ve got
Whether I am the messenger or not
Open the pages
Servants and sages
I’m the messenger
I’m just the messenger
One proclamation
To every nation
I’m the messenger
I’m just the messenger
I got a letter written by the royal king
Rejoice my friends good news I bring
These words are gonna set the captives free
If in your hearts you just believe
I want you to hear the message I’ve got
Whether I am the messenger or not
Open the pages
Servants and sages
I’m the messenger
I’m just the messenger
One proclamation
To every nation
I’m the messenger
I’m just the messenger
I’m on a journey to a distant land
I hold the key to freedom in my hand
I pray the angels come and light my path
Open the pages
Servants and sages
I’m the messenger
I’m just the messenger
One proclamation
To every nation
I’m the messenger
I’m just the messenger
Oh will you hear me
I’ll say it clearly
I’m the messenger
I’m just the messenger
