I know this guy

He's crazy for his girl

And he says

She's everything his whole wide world
And I know
They've got something deep inside

'Cause he's got nothing to hide

And this guy
Says she laughs away the years

Oh but she cries
Those every sort of every kind of tears
And I know
It's love that sweet
Sweet love
And you see
'Cause this is what he said to me

Oh her eyes
They bubble like a sweet champagne
And her lies
They tell me that it's sunny
When I know it's gonna rain

And nothing in the world
Could ever ruin her
The only thing I wish
I could change is
That I woulda met her sooner

Well this guy
Says he doesn't even care

When those other guys
Decide to stop and stare
And he said
I wouldn't doubt it
That they like what they see
And besides
My girl is staring back at me
And she says
That she likes it when he's there

Oh and he knows
She coulda had a millionaire

Oh but it's love
That love
That sweet sweet love
And you see

'Cause this is what he said to me
Oh her eyes
They bubble like a sweet champagne
And her lies
They tell me that it's sunny
When I know it's gonna rain

And nothing in the world
Could ever ruin her
The only thing I wish
I could change is
That I woulda met her sooner
You got to hold on
You got to hold out for me
'Cause laters better
If never is all we'd be
We're waiting on

We're waiting on time time time

Oh oh
So will you hold on
Will you hold out for me
'Cause life is better

Now that you're here with me

We're taking our

We're taking our time time time

For you and me

'Cause her eyes
They bubble like a sweet champagne
And her lies
They tell me that it's sunny
When I know it's gonna rain

And nothing in the world
Could ever ruin her
The only thing I wish
I could change
Oh her eyes
They bubble like a sweet champagne
And her lies
They tell me that it's sunny
When I know it's gonna rain

And nothing in the world
Could ever ruin her
The only thing I wish
I could change is
That I woulda met her sooner

Yeah I woulda met her sooner

Woah oh yeah
Woulda met her sooner

Oh 
Yeah yeah
