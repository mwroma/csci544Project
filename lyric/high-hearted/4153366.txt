i'm tired of being what you want me to be
feeling so faithless lost under the surface
don't know what you're expecting of me
put under the pressure of walking in your shoes
(caught in the undertow just caught in the undertow)
every step i take is another mistake to you
(caught in the undertow just caught in the undertow)
i've become so numb i can't feel you there
i've become so tired so much more aware
i've becoming this all i want to do
is be more like me and be less like you
can't you see that you're smothering me
holding too tightly afraid to lose control
cause everything that you thought i would be
has fallen apart right in front of you
(caught in the undertow just caught in the undertow)
every step that i take is another mistake to you
(caught in the undertow just caught in the undertow)
and every second i waste is more than i can take
i've become so numb i can't feel you there
i've become so tired so much more aware
i've becoming this all i want to do
is be more like me and be less like you
and i know
i may end up failing too
but i know
you were just like me with someone disappointed in you
i've become so numb i can't feel you there
i've become so tired so much more aware
i've becoming this all i want to do
is be more like me and be less like you
i've become so numb i can't feel you there
is everything what you want me to be
i've become so numb i can't feel you there
I'm tired of being what you want me to be
