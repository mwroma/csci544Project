I'm coming to study - study all the nice fine girls
I'm coming to study - study best place in world
I want to have a nice trip - walking with the sun all day
I'm sitting with a Rasta Man on a rgeen brown cocopalm's tray
Sing about
Hey up! Hey up!  I'm talking bout a rising girl
Hey up! Hey up!  I'm talking bout a rising girl
All night we have no troubles - speaking with a bush man free
He is manibush doctor - without any misery
He says "Hey man take a smokey it's good for your apathy"
I'm feeling like a white dove in the sky - far away from family
Sing about
Hey up! Hey up!  I'm talking bout a rising girl
Hey up! Hey up!  I'm talking bout a rising girl
Hey up! Hey up!  I'm talking bout a rising girl
Hey up! Hey up!  I'm talking bout a rising girl
I just（a） - I just（a） make you so good yeah
I just（a） - I just（a） when the regggae is crying
I just（a） - I just（a） call you on the phone
Talk about hey-hey-aaahh - talk about the rising sun
I come home this morning - for why you calling my name?
I come home this morning - for why there playing you are a game?
I wanna be wanna be your man - the man from Kingston town
I wanna be your only love - the one who get's you down
Sing about
Hey up! Hey up!  I'm talking bout a rising girl
Hey up! Hey up!  I'm talking bout a rising girl
Hey up! Hey up!  I'm talking bout a rising girl
Hey up! Hey up!  I'm talking bout a rising girl
Hey up! Hey up!  I'm talking bout a rising girl
Hey up! Hey up!  I'm talking bout a rising girl
a rising girl
