sunday's coming I wanna drive my car
to your apartment with present like a star
forecaster said the weather may be rainy hard
but I know the sun will shine for us
oh lazy seagull fly me from the dark
I dress my jeans and feed my monkey banana
then I think my age how oldskyline how far
or we need each other in california
you show me your body before night comes down
I touch your face and promise to stay ever young
on this ivory beach we kissed so long
it seems that the passion's never gone
you sing me your melody and I feel so please
I want you to want me to keep your dream
together we'll run wild by a summer symphony
this is what we enjoyed not a fantasy
the tin-man's surfing I wanna try my luck
to the top of tide rip like just have some drugs
I know you have no blame for my proud moonish heart
Welcome to the golden beatnik park
oh diamond seashore drag me from the yard
incredible sunward I watch as you're in photograph
for camera your smile's so sweetpalm trees' so lush
would you believe my honey it's califonia
you show me your body before night comes down
I touch your face and promise to stay ever young
on this ivory beach we kissed so long
it seems that the passion's never gone
you sing me your melody and I feel so please
I want you to want me to keep your dream
together we'll run wild by a summer symphony
this is what we enjoyed not a fantasy
