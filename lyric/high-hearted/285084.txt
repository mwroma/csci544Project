Life Is Like A Song
 作曲  Wanting Qu
 作词  Wanting Qu/Nathan Stafford
曲婉婷 -- life is like a song
Do you know the way you walk
the way you talk
the way you said I’d love to
It makes me feel alive
Do you know the way you run your fingers through my hair
And I am with you now
Life is like a
Life is like a song
Sing along
On and on and on and lingers on
Come along
Piece together phrases in a funny way
Life is like a song
It was a rainy day
I got you on the phone
How do you do
It’s been a while or two
a while or two
Suddenly the clouds had disappeared
Love is kind
Love is blind
I don’t mind being your lover’s fool
Life is like a
Life is like a song
Sing along
On and on and on and lingers on
Come along
Piece together phrases in a funny way
Life is like a song
Oh life is like a song
Life is like a song
It has its ups and downs
Oh life is like a song
And it carries us on
Ooooooh it’s like a song
On and on and on
Life is like a song
And it has its ups and downs
It carries us on
Life is like a
Life is like a
Life is like a
Life is like a a a a
a song
