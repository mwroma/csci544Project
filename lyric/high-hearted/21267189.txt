You make me happy whether you know it or not
We should be happy that's what I said from the start
I am so happy
Knowin' you are the one that I want for the rest of my days
For the rest of my days yo all of my days
You're lookin' so cool you're lookin' so fly
I cant deny that when I'm starin' you down and dead in the eye
I wanna try to be the person you want the person you need
It's hard to conceive that somebody like you could be with someone like me
I'm happy knowin' that you are mine
The grass is greener on the other side
The more I think the more I wish that we could lay here for hours and just reminisce
Ooh-ooh
You're lookin' so fresh it's catchin' my eye
Why oh why did I not see this before
The girl I adore was right in front of me
And now I'll take a step back and look in your eye
And ask why it took so long to see we're meant to be
I'm happy knowin' that you are mine
The grass is greener on the other side
The more I think the more I wish that we could lay here for hours and just reminisce
On the good the bad the ugly
The smiles the laughs the funny
Oh the things we put each other through
It's for you for you for you
You make me happy whether you know it or not
We should be happy that's what I said from the start
I am so happy
Knowin' you are the one that I want for the rest of my days
For the rest of my days
I'm happy knowin' that you are mine
The grass is greener on the other side
The more I think the more I wish that we could lay here for hours and just reminisce
Ooh-ooh
