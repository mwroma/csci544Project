They're knockin' on my door
telling me they want more
Hold on hold on
They're bangin' on my window
telling me it's been too long
Hold on yea
telling me they want more
They said they're looking for somethin' new
I gotcha Give me  months and I'll hook you up proper
Something hotter than the biggie who shot you
Watch out I boiled it up like lobsters
They get impatient like waiting at the doctor's
office craving good music like oxy-Gen
but please understand I'm trying to break out of this box I'm in
I'm not stopping 'til I get to ten
It's gotta be flame when that paper hits my pen
Forget hits I ain't worried if it hits a trend
We start a new one watch them stop listening
Yea but 'til then I got people that are ready
Knockin' on my door saying “Hurry up already!”
It takes time so here's the appetizer
To whet your appetite bon appetit!
They're knockin' on my door telling me they want more
Hold on (wait I'm not ready yet) hold on (no I'm not ready yet)
They're bangin' on my window telling me it's been too long
(Wait I'm not ready yet) Hold on (no I'm not ready yet)
Hold on
Yea it's the return of the—hold up
I've never been promoted how could I blow up
I come from a place where they call pop soda
Starts with an “m” and it's not Minnesota
Moved to the south where it gets less colder
And record labels tell you it's all about quotas
Well my vote is that we all take notice of the
fact that nobody knows what to do
Oh but a few people in my corner said keep pushing
People out there want more and they're looking
for good music well let me get them cookin'
I even got attention out of Brooklyn
But that didn't pan out like mono
Haven't found what I'm looking for like Bono
Put on my charm like Alyssa Milano
Hit these high notes like sopranos
They're knockin' on my door telling me they want more
I know what it feels like
to be on that shelf like
everybody's passing you by by
I keep wishing they would notice
but it seems so hopeless
no matter how hard you try!
This world will try to shake you
Mold you and then break you
they ain't worried 'bout your soul soul
Lock that door and bolt it
tell them to move on cause
what we've got is worth waiting for!
They're knockin' on my door telling me they want more
