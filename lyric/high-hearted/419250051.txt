You were the shadow to my light
Did you feel us
Another Star
You fade away
Afraid our aim is out of sight
Wanna see us
They wanna see us alive
Have you ever heard me before everytime you go
It's like I'm never leaving
It's like you never know
The feeling is so strong when you were here I can't pretend
I'm out of my mind
It's hard to say goodbye
Where are you now
Where are you now
When you're alone are you thinking bout me
Cuz I'll always be your deep memory
Where are you now
Where are you now
When everytime I thought you were my dream
Then I realize you are not here with me
I'm so lost
Can you hold me in your arm
These shallow waters never met
What I needed
I'm letting go
A deeper dive
Eternal silence of the sea
I'm breathing
I wanna feel alive
Have you ever seen me behind and watched you walked away
It's like you never leaving
It's like you're always here
I'm lying in the dark and touch myself to feel it's real
You're the one of a kind
Now I should leave you behind
Where are you now
Where are you now
When you're alone are you thinking bout me
Cuz I'll always be your deep memory
Where are you now
Where are you now
When everytime I thought you were my dream
Then I realize you are not here with me
I'm so lost
Can you hold me in your arm
Where are you now
I'm faded
Where are you now
Hey I'm already
Already to forget
Forget about you
Where are you now
Where are you now
Do you know how much I want
I wanna tell you I accept that you're gone
Where are you now
Where are you now
I just loved you where did I go wrong
But I'm not so into you when I'm strong
Am I clear
I don't care why
And what you did
I don't care
Forget about you
