gotta have you
Gray' quiet and tired and mean
Picking at a worried seam
I try to make you mad at me over the phone
Red eyes and fire and signs
I'm taken by a nursery rhyme
I want to make a ray of sunshine and never leave home
No amount of coffee
No amount of crying
No amount of whiskey
No amount of wine
No No No No No
No' nothing else will do
I've gotta have you
I've gotta have you

The road gets cold
There's no spring in the middle this year
I'm the new chicken clucking open hearts and ears
Oh' such a prima donna
Sorry for myself
But green' it is also summer
And i won't be warm till i'm lying in your arms
No amount of coffee
No amount of crying
No amount of whiskey
No amount of wine
No No No No No
No' nothing else will do
I've gotta have you
I've gotta have you

I see it all through a telescope
Guitar' suitcase' and a warm coat
Lying in the back of the blue boat
Humming a tune

No amount of coffee
No amount of crying
No amount of whiskey
No one No No No No No
No' nothing else will do
I've gotta have you
I've gotta have you
No amount of coffee
No amount of crying
No amount of whiskey
No amount of wine
No No No No No
No' nothing else will do
I've gotta have you
I've gotta have you
I've gotta have you
I've gotta have you
I've gotta have you
