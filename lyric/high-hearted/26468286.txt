Oh whoa oh oh oh
Oh whoa oh oh oh
Oh whoa oh oh oh
Oh whoa oh oh oh
Be-be careful making wishes in the dark dark
Can't be sure when it hit that mark
And besides in the mean mean time
I'm just dreaming of tearing you apart
I'm in the deep details with the devil
From underworld can never get me on my level
I just gotta get you up the cage
On my young lovers rage gonna need a spark to ignite
My songs know what you did in the dark
So light 'em up up up
Light 'em up up up
Light 'em up up up
I'm on FIRE!
So light 'em up up up
Light 'em up up up
Light 'em up up up
I'm on FIRE!
Whoa oh oh oh oh
Oh whoa oh oh oh
In the dark dark
Whoa oh oh oh oh
Oh whoa oh oh oh
In the dark dark
Writers keep writing what they write
Somewhere another pretty vein just died
I got the scars from tomorrow and I wish you could see
That you're the antidote to everything except for me
A constellation of tears on your lashes
Burn everything you love then burn the ashes
In the end everything collides my childhood
Spat back out the monster that you see
My songs know what you did in the dark
So light 'em up up up
Light 'em up up up
Light 'em up up up
I'm on FIRE!
So light 'em up up up
Light 'em up up up
Light 'em up up up
I'm on FIRE!
Whoa oh oh oh oh
Oh whoa oh oh oh
In the dark dark
Whoa oh oh oh oh
Oh whoa oh oh oh
In the dark dark
My songs know what you did in the dark
My songs know what you did in the dark
So light 'em up up up
Light 'em up up up
Light 'em up up up
I'm on FIRE!
So light 'em up up up
Light 'em up up up
Light 'em up up up
I'm on FIRE!
Whoa oh oh oh oh
Oh whoa oh oh oh
In the dark dark
Whoa oh oh oh oh
Oh whoa oh oh oh
In the dark dark
Whoa oh oh oh oh
Oh whoa oh oh oh
