bye bye bye
by看别人的风景
When I see you
looking back at me
watching these eyes still
through your fingers
and your eyes
have told a thousand lights
but I cant tell this time
what you really mean it
We've been crossing the wire
and still no spark
lost and tired falling apart
we've been together for forever tell me why why why
do we have to turn around and say goodbye bye bye
and the only thing that's left to do is cry cry cry
nothing left for me to say to you but bye bye bye
I can sing another broken song
trying to hold on to your picture
out of face
you hide behind your face
it's more than I can take
I know you run deeper
We've been crossing the wire
and still no spark
lost and tired falling apart
we've been together for forever tell me why why why
do we have to turn around and say goodbye bye bye
and the only thing that's left to do is cry cry cry
nothing left for me to say to you but bye bye bye
you left me hanging on the light
why you stealing all my time
you take a piss me
you've been drving too slow
so I gotta let you go
before you break me em~yeah~
we've been together for forever tell me why why why
do we have to turn around and say goodbye bye bye
and the only thing that's left to do is cry cry cry
nothing left for me to say to you but bye bye bye
we've been together for forever tell me why why why
do we have to turn around and say goodbye bye bye
and the only thing that's left to do is cry cry cry
nothing left for me to say to you but bye bye bye
Bye Bye
