Walk Away
Looking back on younger days the time has passed
 And nothing stays the same Hey hey hey!

 She was such a pretty girl
With glowing eyes and yellow curls Hey hey hey!

 Stars are in a summer night
 She's wishing that they'd fall down through the atmosphere
For a souvenir
 She's waiting for her Superman her Never land
 Cause he can show the way Hey hey hey!

 Where's her missing piece her mind's been chasing chasing?
A bullet with your name a ticking time grenade
 You better run away run away run away
 Either way you're screwed there's nothing you can do
 You better run away run away run away

She's tellin' tales through telephone
 That make you cry chill to the bone Hey hey hey!

 It's lock and key electrified
 Hide and seek from dirty eyes Hey hey hey!

 Driving in the rain to somewhere far
 But they've got tattoos stamped upon their arms of her name in hearts
 She doesn't understand that love is what you give not given up
 Hey hey hey!

 Where's her missing piece her mind's been chasing chasing?

A bullet with your name a ticking time grenade
 You better run away run away run away
 Either way you're screwed there's nothing you can do
 No matter what you say what you say what you say

Yeah you better not sleep because she's waiting waiting
She knows all about you; you're in her aim

A bullet with your name a ticking time grenade
 You better run away run away run away
 Either way you're screwed there's nothing you can do
 You better run away run away run away
 A bullet with your name a ticking time grenade
 You better run away run away run away
 Either way you're screwed there's nothing you can do
 No matter what you say what you say what you say
