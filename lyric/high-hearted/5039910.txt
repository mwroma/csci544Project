introducing me
I'm good at wasting time
I think lyrics need to rhyme
And you're not asking
But I'm trying to grow a moustache
I eat cheese but only on pizza please
And sometimes on a homemade quesadilla
Otherwise it smells like feet to me
And I I really like it when the moon looks like a toenail
And I love you when you say my name

If you wanna know
Here it goes
Gonna tell you this
The part of me that'll show if you're close
Gonna let you see everything
But remember that you asked for it
I'll try to do my best to impress
But it's easier to let you take a guess at the rest
But you wanna hear what lives in my brain
My heart will you ask for it for your perusing?
At times confusing slightly amusing
Introducing me
Doo doo doo doo doo doo to
Doo doo doo doo doo doo to
La la la la
La la la la la la la la da

I never trust a dog to watch my food
And I like to use to the word "dude"
As a noun or an adverb or an adjective
And I've never really been into cars
I like really cool guitars and superheroes
And checks with lots of zeros on 'em
I love the sound of violins
And making someone smile

If you wanna know
Here it goes
Gonna tell you this
The part of me that'll show if you're close
Gonna let you see everything
But remember that you asked for it
I'll try to do my best to impress
But it's easier to let you take a guess at the rest
But you wanna hear what lives in my brain
My heart will you ask for it for your perusing?
At times confusing possibly amusing
Introducing me
Well you probably know more than you ever wanted to
So be careful when you ask next time

So if you wanna know
Here it goes
Gonna tell you this
The part of me that'll show if you're close
Gonna let you see everything
But remember that you asked for it
I'll try to do my best to impress
But it's easier to let you take a guess at the rest
But you wanna hear what lives in my brain
My heart will you ask for it for your perusing?
At times confusing hopefully amusing
Introducing me
Doo doo doo doo doo doo to
Doo doo doo doo doo doo to
Doo doo doo doo
