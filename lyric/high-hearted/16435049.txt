someone like you
 作曲  Adele Adkins/Dan Wilson
 作词  Adele Adkins/Dan Wilson
I heard
That your settled down
That you found a girl
And your married now
I heard
That your dreams came true
Guess she gave you things
I didn't give to you
Old friend
Why are you so shy
It ain't like you to hold back
Or hide from the light
I hate to turn up out of the blue uninvited
But I couldn't stay away I couldn't fight it
I had hoped you'd see my face and that you'd be reminded
That for me it isn't over
Never mind
I'll find someone like you
I wish nothing but the best for you too
Don't forget me I beg
I'll remember you said
Sometimes it lasts in love
But sometimes it hurts instead
Sometimes it lasts in love
But sometimes it hurts instead
You know how the time flies
Only yesterday was the time of our lives
We were born and raised
In a summer haze
Bound by the surprise
Of our glory days
I hate to turn up out of the blue uninvited
But I couldn't stay away I couldn't fight it
I had hoped you'd see my face and that you'd be reminded
That for me it isn't over
Never mind
I'll find someone like you
I wish nothing but the best
For you too
Don't forget me I beg
I'll remember you said
Sometimes it lasts in love
But sometimes it hurts instead
Nothing compares
No worries or cares
Regrets and mistakes
They're memories made
Who would have known
How bitter sweet
This would taste
Never mind
I'll find someone like you
I wish nothing but the best
For you
Don't forget me I beg
I'll remember you said
Sometimes it lasts in love
But sometimes it hurts instead
Never mind
I'll find someone like you
I wish nothing but the best
For you too
Don't forget me I beg
I'll remember you said
Sometimes it lasts in love
But sometimes it hurts instead
Sometimes it lasts in love
But sometimes it hurts instead
