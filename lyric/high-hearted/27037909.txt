The world is moving at the speed of light
A million hearts are bouncing off a satellite
You got the answer in the palm of your hand
So many things that I don’t understand
A whoo-hoo whoo-hoo honey
A whoo-hoo it’s a crazy world
People talking through the video
Everybody’s got their own damn TV show
And every day we’re on something new
But none of that is gonna get closer
To yoo-hoo whoo-hoo honey
Yoo-hoo whoo-hoo honey
I wanna just slow down
It’s a crazy world
I wanna hold you now
Just a boy and girl
Sitting on a porch swing laying low
Singing with the songs on the radio
I wanna just slow down
It’s a crazy world
They're lining up to start another war
But can you really tell me what we’re fighting for?
Stuck in the middle of a hurricane
I think the world just might be going insane
A whoo-hoo whoo-hoo honey
Whoo-hoo whoo-hoo honey
I wanna just slow down
It’s a crazy world
I wanna hold you now
Just a boy and girl
Sitting on a porch swing laying low
Singing with the songs on the radio
I wanna just slow down
It’s a crazy world
I ain't gonna make the world change
I don't gotta win the rat race
I just wanna see your face tonight
I wanna just slow down
It’s a crazy world
I wanna hold you now
We're just a boy and girl
I wanna just slow down
It's a crazy world
I wanna hold you now
Just a boy and girl
Sitting on a porch swing laying low
Singing with the songs on the radio
I wanna just slow down
It’s a crazy world
It's a crazy world
It's a crazy world
