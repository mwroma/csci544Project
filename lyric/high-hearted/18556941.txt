Love Like You Loved
Help me to love like You loved
To serve like You served
To speak only words of truth
Help me to care like You cared
For a world in despair
Help me to love like You
There are lots of different people
From a lot of different places
With lots of different points of view
There's a lot of debating - lot of speculating
But there can only be one truth
Some would say You're a leader claim You're a liar
Some would even say that You're a fool
But I know You're a healer the perfect Messiah
And I want to live life like You
So help me to love like You loved
To serve like You served
To speak only words of truth
Help me to care like You cared
For a world in despair
Help me to love like You
The philosophers ignored you
The Pharisees abhorred you
Because you didn't follow their rules
But sinners were changed and their lives rearranged
When they put their trust in you
So help me to love like You loved
Serve like You served
To speak only words of truth
Help me to care like You cared
For a world in despair
Help me to love like You
Hallelujah You're the truth
Show us how to love like You
Hallelujah You're the truth
Show us how to love like You
Help me to love like You loved
To serve like You served
To speak only words of truth
Help me to care like You cared
For a world in despair
Help me to love like You
Help me to love like You loved
To serve like You served
To speak only words of truth
Help me to care like You cared
For a world in despair
Help me to love like You
