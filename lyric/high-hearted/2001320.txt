valder fields
 作曲  Tamas Wells
 作词  Tamas Wells
I was found on the ground by the fountain at valder
fields and was almost dry
lying in the sun after I had tried
lying in the sun by the side
We had agreed that the council would end at
three hours over time
shoelaces were tied at the traffic lights
I was running late I could apply
For another one I guess
If department stores are best
They said there would be delays and
only temporary pay
For another one I guess
If department stores are best
They said there would be delays and
only temporary pay
She was found on the ground in a gown made at valder
fields and was sound asleep
on the stairs outside the door to the man who cried
when he said that he loved his life
We had agreed that the council should take his
keys to the bedroom door
incase he sleeped outside and was found in two
days in valder fields with a mountain view
