When the bluebirds come out to sing
i hear a melody so sweet
a beautiful song
and i hear laughter as children play
it s a prefect day to say
i m glad that i m alive
feel good sunshine
i ve opened my eyes
feel good sunshine
i look to sky
when it is grey
it will be brighter days
my piece of mind feel good sunshine
when the storm come and toss the sea
i hear a smthany resound
do recall it
in darkest days and in darkest times
i hear a melody so sweet
but that s when i find
feel good sunshine
i open my eyes
feel good sunshine
i look to the sky
when it is grey there will be brighter days
my piece of mind
feel good sunshine
(whistle)

feel good sunshine
i open my eyes
feel good sunshine
i look to the sky
when it is grey
there be brighter day
my piece of mind
feel good sunshine
