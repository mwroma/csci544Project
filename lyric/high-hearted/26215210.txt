Sometimes I find that I get too sentimental
too sentimental when I think of you
Sometimes it helps to play some heavy heavy metal
But somehow heavy metal makes me think of you too

I met you on a road of corduroy and maple
corduroy and maple and I sang to you
Early one morning drinking Kapuskasing coffee
Kapuskasing coffee and I sang to you

All the roads are washed out in the town
But the posterboys of North America are still around

All the roads are six feet underground

But god bless the posterboys of North America for sticking around

Sometimes I find that I get too sentimental
too sentimental when I think of you
Early one morning drinking Kapuskasing coffee
I had your arms around me as I sang to you

All the roads are washed out in the town

But the posterboys of North America are still around

All the roads are six feet underground

But god bless the posterboys of North America for sticking around

Sometimes it helps to play some heavy heavy metal

Sometimes it helps to drink some Kapuskasing coffee

Sometimes it helps to play some heavy heavy metal

Sometimes it helps to drink some Kapuskasing coffee
