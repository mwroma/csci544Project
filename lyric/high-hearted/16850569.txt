Have A Nice Day
bybrucemoney
Why you wanna tell me how to live my life?
Who are you to tell me if it’s black or white?
Mama can you help me try to understand
Is innocence the difference between a boy and a man
My daddy lived a lie
Its just the price that he paid
Sacrificed his life just slaving away
Ohhh if there’s one thing I hang onto
That gets me through the night
I ain't gonna do what I don’t want to
I'm gonna live my life
Shining like a diamond
Rolling with the dice
Standing on the ledge
Just show the wind how to fly
When the world gets in my face
I say have a nice day
Have a nice day
Take a look around you nothings what it seems
We’re living in a broken home of hopes and dreams
Let me be the first to shake your helping hand
Everybody brave enough to take a stand
I knocked on every door on every dead end street
Looking for forgiveness
What’s left to believe?
Ohhh~
Now when this world keeps trying to drag me down
I've gotta raise my hands
Gonna stand my ground
I say hey have a nice day
