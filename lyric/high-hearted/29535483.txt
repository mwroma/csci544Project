They say we are what we are
But we don't have to be
I'm bad behavior but I do it in the best way
I'll be the watcher (watcher)
Of the eternal flame
I'll be the guard dog
of all your fever dreams
Oooooooh
I am the sand in the bottom half
Of the hourglass (glass glass)
Oooooooh
I try to picture me without you but I can't
Cause we could be Immortals Immortals
Just not for long for long
And live with me forever now
Pull the blackout curtains down
Just not for long for long
Because we could be Immooooooo- Immortals
Immooooooo- Immortals
Immooooooo- Immortals
Immooooooo- Immortals
Sometimes the only pay off
For having any faith
Is when it's tested again and again
Everyday
I'm still comparing your past
To my future
It might be your wound
but they're my sutures
Oooooooh
I am the sand in the bottom half
Of the hourglass (glass glass)
Oooooooh
I try to picture me without you but I can't
Cause we could be Immortals Immortals
Just not for long for long
And live with me forever now
Pull the blackout curtains down
Just not for long for long
Because we could be Immooooooo- Immortals
Immooooooo- Immortals
Immortals
And live with me forever now
Pull the blackout curtains down
Because we could be Immortals Immortals
Just not for long for long
We could be Immooooooo- Immortals
Immooooooo- Immortals
Immooooooo- Immortals
Immooooooo- Immortals
