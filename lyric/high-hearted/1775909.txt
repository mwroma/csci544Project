Don't have this world all outfigured
It always rains the days I plan to walk outside
But I'll be fine just stuck inside
you and I
Oh I know someday
That your love will come my way
Til then I'll Keep dreaming of love a little longer
Long enough make to it seem real

I keep dreaming your love is gonna come
And you'll notice how I’ve always been here

Yea I know someday our paths will cross
We'll start as friends
You'll be Rachel Ibe ’Rossll
And we'll make up for the time we lost
I'll be better off
Once you're here to stay

Once your love has come my way

Til then I'll
Keep dreaming of love a little longer
Long enough to make it seem real

And I keep dreaming your love is gonna come
And you'll notice how I've always been here

hereI'm

standing here
I'm in the clear

I'll be here to stay
Once your love has come my way

then Til I'll
Keep dreaming of love a little longer
Long enough to make it seem real

And I keep dreaming your love is going to come
And you'll notice how I've always been here

Keep dreaming of love a little longer
And you'll notice how I've always been here

I'm here standing here I'm in the clear
