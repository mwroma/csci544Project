Space calling earth again
Say what
Houston this is the end
We’re lost
Tick tick tick tack
Time’s up
Station is shutting down
Bad luck

Barberalla meets godzilla
Since you invited both cling to your pantyhose…

I want to Thank you much
Thank you very Much
Thank you very much
I wanna say I’m sorry but I’m really not
Guess I’ve had enough
I’m feeling Dangerous
I wanna say I care but I’m gonna say

Fresh out of graitude
It’s gone
You suck like your attitiude
I won
Flake flakey flakey flake
So sad
I am stirred but I will not shake
It’s rad

Barbarella she's a killer
Run to your nanny go cling to your pantyhose

I want to Thank you much
Thank you very Much
Thank you very much
I wanna say I’m sorry but I’m really not
I guess I’ve had enough
I’m feeling Dangerous
I wanna say I care but I’m gonna say

’bout this thrilla’ in Manilla’
What goes around my friend bites you right at the end
I want to Thank you much
Thank you very Much
Thank you very much
I wanna say I’m sorry but I’m really not
I guess I’ve had enough
I’m feeling Dangerous
I wanna say I care but I’m gonna say

Thank you very Much
Thank you very much
I wanna say I’m sorry but I’m really not
I guess I’ve had enough
I’m feeling Dangerous
I wanna say I care but I’m gonna say
