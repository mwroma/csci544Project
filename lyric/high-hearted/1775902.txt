You’re a tough love
hard to follow
Your strong heart might leave me hollow
But I won t regret a thing
And although the pain and sorrow
Might come my way tomorrow
But I won’t regret a thing
If you’re in
say you’re in it for good
If I give love
I want to get it back
If you’re in
say you’re in it for good
Cause I never wanna try to have to love again
If cold winds should drown the laughter
Know hands down you’re the one I’m after
So let’s love with no regrets
Should words not come out clever
We’ll laugh cause you know me better
And we’ve loved with no regrets
If you’re in
say you’re in it for good
If I give love I want to get it back
If you’re in
say you’re in it for good
Cause I never wanna try to have to love again
In the winter I’ll warm your hands
And tell you time and again
How you’re all I need
There is no love to ever compete with
Your tough love
hard to follow
Your strong heart might leave me hollow
But I won’t regret
If you’re in
say you’re in it for good
If I give love
I want to get it back
If you’re in
say you’re in it for good
Cause I never wanna try to have to love again
If you’re in
say you’re in it for good
If I give love
I want to get it back
If you’re in
say you’re in it for good
Cause I never wanna try to have to love again
If you’re in
say you’re in it for good
Cause I never wanna try to have to love again
