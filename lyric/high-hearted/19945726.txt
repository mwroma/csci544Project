I''m waking up to ash and dust
I wipe my brow and I sweat my rust
I''m breathing in the chemicals gahh ahhh
I''m breaking in shaping up
then checking out on the prison bus
This is it the apocalypse woah
I''m waking up I feel it in my bones
Enough to make my systems go
Welcome to the new age to the new age
Welcome to the new age to the new age
Woah woah I''m radioactive radioactive
Woah woah I''m radioactive radioactive
I raise my flag and dye my clothes
It''s a revolution I suppose
We''re painted red to fit right in woah
I''m breaking in shaping up
then checking out on the prison bus
This is it the apocalypse woah
I''m waking up I feel it in my bones
Enough to make my systems go
Welcome to the new age to the new age
Welcome to the new age to the new age
Woah woah I''m radioactive radioactive
Woah woah I''m radioactive radioactive
All systems go sun hasn''t died
Deep in my bones straight from inside
I''m waking up I feel it in my bones
Enough to make my systems go
Welcome to the new age to the new age
Welcome to the new age to the new age
Woah woah I''m radioactive radioactive
Woah woah I''m radioactive radioactive
