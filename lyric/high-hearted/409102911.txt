Well I've seen the aurora lights
I passed out in Shibuya at night
I broke my arm yea but now it's fine
I keep moving on and on
And I've had a broken heart
Put it back together watched it fall apart
I started over from the start
I keep moving on and on
So tell me what it means when
Everything I see is grey and I can't believe
I'm just going through the motions
Hoping to feel something
Cause baby life is tired when you're on the road
There's lots of pretty faces that I don't know
I could have a million people at my show
I'd rather come home
Now time is flying fast and I'm getting old
Don't wanna venture forth into the unknown
I'd be too afraid to be all alone
I'm coming
Ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-home
Ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-home
I'm coming
Ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-home
