Go on
Go on
Go on go on going on
手举起来摇晃
用力快乐别偷懒
Go on go on going on
继续跳继续唱
世界末日never come

在这里 都归我管

不准再 忧郁悲观 世纪末
又怎么样 地球还在转
快来狂欢

Go on go on going on
手举起来摇晃
用力快乐别偷懒
（You've got to）
Go on go on going on
继续跳继续唱
世界末日never come

you were stupid' destructive'
soulless' careless' murderous'
malignant' belligerent' ignorant'

would you believe me
would you like that
I like-a'
or would you prove me wrong and fight back
take a sunshine right from the sky and let it shine on'
you'll see we're all in the same boat'
look through my eyes'
trying to float' so everybody grab a hold'
we can make it to shore
Go on go on going on
用力快乐别偷懒
（You've got to）
Go on go on going on
继续跳继续唱
世界末日never come

在这里 都归我管

不准再 忧郁悲观 世纪末
又怎么样 地球还在转
快来狂欢
还要作梦 还要疯狂 还要还要 我还要玩

嘿 一起来欢唱

让整个宇宙听到
你的肺活量
喔喂 High again 今晚的快乐要让它永远Go on
