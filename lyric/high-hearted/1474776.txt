Well you done done me and you better felt it
I tried to be chill but you so hot that i melted
I fell right through the cracks and i'm tryin to get back
before the cool done run out i'll be givin it my bestest
and nothin's gonna stop me but divine intervention
I reckon it's again my turn to win some or learn some
i won't hesitate no moreno more
it cannot waiti'm yours
Well open up your mind and see like me
open up your plans and damn you're free
look into your heart and you'll find love love love
listen to the music of the moment maybe seen with me
Ah la peaceful melodie
It's your god forsaken right to be loved loved loved loved Loved
So i won't hesitate no moreno more
it cannot wait i'm sure
there's no need to complicate our time is short
this is our fate i'm yours
I've been spendin' way too long checkin' my tongue in the mirror
and bendin' over backwards just to try to see it clearer
my breath fogged up the glass
and so I drew a new face and laughed
I guess what I'm a sayin'is there ain't no better reason
to rid yourself of vanity and just go with the seasons
it's what we aim to do
our name is our virtue
I won't hesitate no more no more
it cannot wait i'm sure
there's no need to complicate(Well open up your mind and see like me)
our time is short(open up your plans and damn you're free)
it cannot wait  i'm yours(look into your heart and you'll find love love love)
there's no I won't hesitate(listen to the music of the moment maybe seen with me)
no more no more(Ah la peaceful melodie)
it cannot wait i'm sure(It's your god forsaken right to be loved loved loved loved Loved)
there's no need to complicate(Well open up your mind and see like me)
our time is short(open up your plans and damn you're free)
this is our fate  i'm yours(look into your heart and you'll find love love love)
no please don't complicate(listen to the music of the moment maybe seen with me)
our time is short(Ah la peaceful melodie)
