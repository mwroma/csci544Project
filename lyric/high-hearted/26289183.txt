On a dark desert highway
cool wind in my hair
warm smell of colutas
rising up through the air
Up ahead in the distance
I saw a shimmering light
My head grew heavy and my sight grew dim
I had to stop for the night
there she stood in the doorway
I heard the mission bell
and I was thinking to myself
this could be heaven or this could be hell
then she lift it up a candle
and she showed me the way
there were voice down in corridor
I thought I heard them say
welcome to the hotel California
such a lovely place
such a lovely face
plenty of rooms at the hotel California
any time of year
you can find it here
her mind is tiffary-twisted
she godthe mercedes-bens
she got a lot of pretty pretty boys
that she calls friends
how they dance in the courtyard
sweet summers sweat
some dance to remember some dance to forget
so I called up the captain
please bring me my wine he said"
we haven't had that spirit
here since nineteen sixty nine
and still those voises are calling from far away
wake up in the middle of the night
just to hear them say
welcome to the hotel California
such a lovely place
such a lovely face
they live in'it up in the hotel California
what nice surprise
bring your alibis
mirrors on the celling
the pink champagne on iceand she said"
we are all just prisoners here
of our own device
and in the master's chambers
they gatheres for the feast
they stab it with their steely knives
but they just can't kill the beast
last thing I remember
I was running for the door
I had to find the passage back
to the place I was before
relax said the night man
we are programmed to receive
you can check out any time you like
but you can never leave
