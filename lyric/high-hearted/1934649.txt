Shape Of My Heart
 作曲  Sting/Dominic Miller
 作词  Sting/Dominic Miller
He deals the cards as a meditation
And those he plays never suspect
He doesn't play for the money he wins
He doesn't play for respect
He deals the cards to find the answer
The sacred geometery of chance
The hidden law of a probable outcome
The numbers lead a dance
I know that the spades are swords of a soldier
I know that the clubs are weapons of war
I know that diamonds mean money for this art
But that's not the shape of my heart
He may play the jack of diamonds
He may lay the queen of spades
He may conseal a king in his hand
While the memory of it fades
I know that the spades are swords of a soldier
I know that the clubs are weapons of war
I know that the diamonds mean money for this art
But that's not the shape of my heart
But that's not the shapeshape of my heart
And if i told you that i loved you
You'd maybe think there's something wrong
I'm not a man of too many faces
The mask i wear is one
Those who speak know nothing
And find out to their cost
Like those who curse their luck in too many places
Are those who fear a lost
I know that the spades are swords of a soldier
I know that the clubs are weapons of war
I know that diamonds mean money for this art
But that's not the shape of my heart
But that's not the shape of my heart
Thats not the shapeshape of my heart
