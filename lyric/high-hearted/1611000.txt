Call You Mine
About not too long ago I woke up feeling kind of blue (So I)
Picked up my phone and I decided that I hit up you (So then)
We talked for a little while ask me if I could roll through (So we)
Met up got food and we spent time till the night was through
(Can I) call you my own and can I call you my lover
Call you my one and only girl

(Can I) call you my everything call you my baby

You're the only one who runs my world

I remember this night we had outside on the grass us two (We were)
Gazin' at stars who smiled as my eyes only turned towards you (I knew)

There was no one else I needed and my love's never felt this way (I wasn't)
Too sure if you would mind I was nervous but I had to say
(Can I) call you my own and can I call you my lover

Call you my one and only girl
(Can I) call you my everything call you my baby

You're the only one who runs my world

Aye call me now call me later or call me whenever
Call me friend call me lover or call me whatever
I call you mine No ownership implied whatsoever
I call you what it is a natural blend together
Them other brothers like to holler forever
I holler now how I sent to you with

I ain't telling you can get it If not you can imagine
Enough with the rap time for some action
(Can I) call you my own and can I call you my lover
Call you my one and only girl

(Can I) call you my everything call you my baby
You're the only one who runs my world

(Can I) call you my own and can I call you my lover

Call you my one and only girl

(Can I) call you my everything call you my baby
You're the only one who runs my world
