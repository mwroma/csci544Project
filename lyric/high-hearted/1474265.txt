Stay The Night
 作词  BLOUNT JAMES/MARLEY BOB/ROBSON STEVE/TEDDER RYAN
It's  degrees zero chance of rain
It's been a perfect day
We're all spinning on our heels so far away from real
In California
We watched the sunset from our car we all took it in
And by the time that it was dark you and me had something yeah!
And if this is what we've got then what we've got is gold
We're shining bright and I want you I want you to know
The morning's on it's way our friends all say goodbye
There's nowhere else to go I hope that you'll stay the night
Wooo you'll stay the night
Woooyeah
We've been singing Billie Jean
Mixin' vodka with caffeine
We've got strangers stopping by
And though you're out of tune
Girl you blow my mind you do
And I'll say I don't wanna say good night
There's no quiet corner to get to know each other
And there's no hurry I'm a patient man
Is your discover
Cause if this is what we've got then what we've got is gold
We're shining bright and I want you I want you to know
The morning's on it's way our friends all say goodbye
There's nowhere else to go I hope that you'll stay the night
Wooo you'll stay the night
Woooyeah
Just like the song on our radio set
We'll share the shelter of my single bed
But it's a different tune that's stuck in my head
And it goes…
If this is what we've got then what we've got is gold
We're shining bright and I want you I want you to know
The morning's on it's way our friends all say goodbye
There's nowhere else to go I hope that you'll stay the night
If this is what we've got then what we've got is gold
We're shining bright and I want you I want you to know
The morning's on it's way our friends all say goodbye
There's nowhere else to go I hope that you'll stay the night
