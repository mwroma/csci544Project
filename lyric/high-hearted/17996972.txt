Come with me for a little ride see the shadows passing by
Look at the sun and see the clouds turn to faces in the sky
We've been awake all night shattered dreams all around
Close your sad sad eyes we will be safe and sound

Come with me for a little ride see the shadows passing by
Look at the sun and see the clouds turn to faces in the sky
Daydreaming lightly through the rainAll's forgiven on a summer train

Come with me for a little ride see the shadows passing by
Seems we are a thousand miles away from last night
As you sigh in my ear kiss the rain goodbye

Come with me for a little ride see the shadows passing by
Look at the sun and see the clouds turn to faces in the sky
Daydreaming lightly through the rain
All's forgiven on a summer train

Come with me for a little ride see the shadows passing by
Come away with me it's gonna be all right just breathe
Come away with me it's gonna be all right you'll see

And the windows are cryin'  but this train is flyin'  us all through the rain I feel
And the sky is getting brighter with every mile
And it all seems clear

Come with me for a little ride see the shadows passing by
Look at the sun and see the clouds turn to faces in the sky
Daydreaming lightly through the rain
All's forgiven on a summer train

Come with me for a little ride see the shadows passing by
Come away with me it's gonna be all right just breathe
Come away with me it's gonna be all right you'll see

Come away with me it's gonna be all right just breathe
Come away with me it's gonna be all right you'll see you'll see
Come away with me
