Everyday at twilight
When the sun turns red in the sky
I think of you on that shoreline
Brushing your hair from your eyes
We were drawing our names on the wet sand
And running away as it's like
Wherever you are no matter how far
I promise that I won't give up on you
They say other side means other lie
They couldn't be further from the truth
Cause I'm in love with you
I'm still in love with you
Even if there is an ocean
Keeping your heart from mine
That doesn't mean I'm not thinking
About you all the time
I'm counting the days till I see you
And somewhere I know that you are too
Wherever you are no matter how far
I promise that I won't give up on you
They say the other side means other lie
They couldn't be further from the truth
Cause I'm in love with you
I'm still in love with you
Summertime of our lives
Nothing has ever felt so right
Summertime of our lives
Even though we had to say goodbye
I know when the world gets wrong
You'll come back to me
Cause wherever you are no matter how far
I promise that I won't give up on you
They say the other side means other lie
They couldn't be further from the truth
Wherever you are no matter how far
I promise that I won't give up on you
They say other side means other lie
They couldn't be further from the truth
I'm in love with you
I'm still in love with you
I'm still in love with you
