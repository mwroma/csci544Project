Lookin' at the cop in the rear view mirror
probably shoulda' stopped but the crosswalk was clear
I'll just imagine it's a ticket to a Broadway show
Lookin' at the clouds and they seem kinda funny
probably gonna rain but my outlook is sunny
I'll just imagine that I'm layin' out in Mexico
'Cause I know that pleasures gotta come with pain
and I know that things won't always go my way
and I know life is gonna suck some days
But I can't complain
I can't complain
Every day's too short to let it go to waste
And I can't complain
I can't complain
You gotta treat every day like a holiday
And I'm tellin' you that I know some days I'm gonna stumble
and I know the cookie's gonna crumble
and I know life is gonna suck some days but I can't complain
Waitin' on a never ending train at the crossing
payin' it no mind 'cause you just keep on talkin'
We'll just imagine it's the good old days and take it slow
Spending Christmas eve on the floor at the airport
dying to get back to the people that I care for
smile and just dream about my puppy in my bed back home
'Cause I know that pleasures gotta come with pain
and I know that things won't always go my way
and I know life is gonna suck some days
But I can't complain
I can't complain
Every day's too short to let it go to waste
And I can't complain
I can't complain
You gotta treat every day like a holiday
And I'm tellin' you that I know some days I'm gonna stumble
and I know the cookie's gonna crumble
and I know life is gonna suck some days
If you can't say nothin' good don't say nothin'
If you stop to think you could come up with somethin'
That makes you feel so good when time's are rough it's okay
I can't complain (Oh oh oh oh oh x)
Don't let it go to waste
Now I can't complain (I can't complain)
I can't complain (I can't complain)
Every day's too short to let it go to waste
Now I can't complain (I can't complain)
I can't complain (I can't complain)
You gotta treat every day like a holiday
And I'm tellin' you that I know some days I'm gonna stumble
and I know the cookie's gonna crumble
and I know life is gonna suck some days
but I can't complain
