La la la-la la la la-la la la la-la ah la-la
La la la-la la la la-la la la la-la ah la-la
There's a window into a magical place
Where I've always wanted to go
And am I dreaming or am I awake
I don't know it just feels like home
'Cause Santa's always on the way
It's Christmas morning every day
Sometimes I wished I lived in a snow globe
Where the wind blows
It's wonderful
And every single time that you shake it
You'll make it
So beautiful
La la la-la la la la-la la la la-la ah la-la
La la la-la la la la-la la la la-la ah la-la
Candy canes they grow on trees
And snowmen come out to play
Everyone lives in a gingerbread house
What a shimmering holiday
Come with me yeah take my hand
To glitter blizzard wonderland
Sometimes I wished I lived in a snow globe
Where the wind blows
It's wonderful
And every single time that you shake it
You'll make it
So beautiful
La la la-la la la la-la la la la-la ah la-la
La la la-la la la la-la la la la-la ah la-la
