it's all it's all
you are my sunshine after the rain
you are the cure against my fear my pain
cause i'm losing my mind
when you're not around
it's all it's all
it's all because of you
you are my sunshine
oh yeah~
baby i really know by now
since we met that day
you showed me the way
i felt it then you give me love
i can't describe
how much i feel for you
i said baby i
should have known by now
should have been right there
whenever you gave me love
and if only you were here
i tell you Yes i tell you

cause i'm losing my mind
when you're not around
it's all it's all

oh~~~oh yeah~~~
honestly could you be with me
like it was before
nither less nor more
cause when i close my eyes at night
i realize that no one else
could ever take your place
i still can feel and it's so unreal
when you touching me
kisses endlessly
it's just the place in the sun
when our loves began
i miss you Yes i miss you
oh baby~
you are my sunshine after the rain
you are the cure against my fear and my pain
cause i'm losing my mind
when you're not around
it's all it's all
it's all because of you
if i knew how to tell you
what's on my mind
（make you understand）
then i'd always be there
right by your side
you are my sunshine after the rain
you are the cure against my fear and my pain
cause i'm losing my mind
when you're not around
it's all it's all
it's all because of you
you are my sunshine after the rain
you are the cure against my fear and my pain
cause i'm losing my mind
when you're not around
it's all it's all
it's all because of you
you are my sunshine after the rain
you are the cure against my fear my pain
cause i'm losing my mind
when you're not around
it's all it's all
it's all because of you
