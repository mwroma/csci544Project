It’s unbelievable
This is as good as it gets
It’s unbelievable
Don’t know what’s gonna happen next
It’s unbelievable
You haven’t seen nothing yet
It’s unbelievable it’s unbelievable
When I was a kid I saved up all my dough so I could buy C-PO
Put Mentos in my Diet Coke in the back seat of the bus
When I was a kid I ate SpaghettiOs played laser tag and GI Joes
And if you vowed "No Girls Allowed"  then you could join the club
When I was a kid I spent my Saturday’s blowing on Nintendo games
The newest thing was Lion King and I could fell the love
It’s unbelievable
This is as good as it gets
It’s unbelievable
Don’t know what’s gonna happen next
It’s unbelievable
You haven’t seen nothing yet
It’s unbelievable it’s unbelievable

When I was a kid I dreamed of Power Wheels
Stayed up late watching action films
And I won’t lies my friends and I were too legit to quit
When I was a kid i lived for ColourTRIS ate Dr Pepper jelly beans
My favorite part of Jurassic Park was how real the Raptors looked
When I was a kid I still had VHS watched Fresh Prince and Jazzy Jeff
Zac Murris owned the first cell phone and it was off the hook
It’s unbelievable
This is as good as it gets
It’s unbelievable
Don’t know what’s gonna happen next
It’s unbelievable
You haven’t seen nothing yet
It’s unbelievable it’s unbelievable
Gak pogs and Floam and Home Alone Berenstain Bears and bean bag chairs
My LA looks and Goosebumps books oh Etch-A-Sketch what happened next
Grape Juicyjuice and Dr Seuss piggy-back rides and Slip N' Slides
Mcdonold's fries those were the best what happens next
It’s unbelievable
This is as good as it gets
It’s unbelievable
Don’t know what’s gonna happen next
It’s unbelievable
You haven’t seen nothing yet
It’s unbelievable those were the days Oh!
It’s unbelievable
When I think back on them man
It’s unbelievable
Cause baby those were the days
It’s unbelievable
It ruled in so many ways
It’s unbelievable it’s unbelievable
I'm so amazed those were the days
