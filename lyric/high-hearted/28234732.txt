Air Balloon
Somebody remind me where I am Miami or Timbuktu
Did I ever tell you my uncle's monkey ran away from the zoo
Would you tell me what this all means
What happens if I go through that door
'Cause I'm looking up at the ceiling but it's turing into the floor
When I'm bored I kind of drift away
I'm not sure quite why we work all day
I've been thinking and I've got this plan
Let's go right now
Come meet me in the sky I'll be waiting for you
And we can't hear what they say
Up in my air balloon air balloon air balloon
Sing sing along along any song you want to
Now we're so high it can't rain
Up in my air balloon air balloon air balloon
I don't like dropppig names but Kurt Cobain is all in my face
How the hell am I gonna tell him Elvis already took first place
And then out of the blue this cruise is loosing altitude
All we need is a little more elevation
Take me back to where I can breathe
When I'm bored I kind of drift away
I'm not sure quite why we work all day
I've been thinking and I've got this plan
Let's go right now
Come meet me in the sky I'll be waiting for you
And we can't hear what they say
Up in my air balloon air balloon air balloon
Sing sing along along any song you want to
Now we're so high it can't rain
Up in my air balloon air balloon air balloon
Shake it sh-shake it now
Gimme gi-gimme gimme some
Sailing s-sailing through the clouds
Trippin' tri-tri-trippin' now
Shake it sh-shake it now
Gimme gi-gimme gimme some
Sailing s-sailing through the clouds
Trippin' tri-tri-trippin' now
Come meet me in the sky I'll be waiting for you
And we can't hear what they say
Up in my air balloon air balloon air balloon
Sing sing along along any song you want to
Now we're so high it can't rain
Up in my air balloon air balloon air balloon
Come meet me in the sky
Up in my air balloon air balloon air balloon
Come meet me in the sky
Up in my air balloon air balloon air balloon
