tiBack in Time
arJake Nauta
your  pure  heart  and  open  mind 
you're  making  me  go  back  in  time
let's  go  back  in  time
sweet  memory  plugs  in  my  mind
to  go  to  back i'm  back  in  time
let's  go  back  in  time
woo--time
i  wanna  go  back  to  the  dayi  loved  you  like  a  child
over  and  over  i  wanna  say
your  love  is  the  only  way
your honesty words untainted eyes
your  innocence  makes  me  look  in  side
i'll  go  back  some  timewoo
i  wanna  go  back  to  the  dayi  loved  you  like  a  child
over  and  over  i  wanna  say
your  love  is  the  only  way
i  wanna  go  back  to  the  dayi  loved  you  like  a  child
over  and  over  i  wanna  say
your  love  is  the  only  way
your  love  is  the  only  wayonly  wayback  to  will
i  wanna  be  back  to  life  if  you  take  me  back  to  hope
back  to  what  i  knowback  to  my  hope  away  from  home
i  wanna  go  back  to  the  dayi  loved  you  like  a  child
over  and  over  i  wanna  say
i  loved  you  like  a  child
i  wanna  go  back  to  the  day
i  wanna  go  back  to  the  day
i  wanna  go  back  to  the  day
