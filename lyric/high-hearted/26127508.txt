I don't know what it is I wanted to say
I couldn't find words even if I tried anyway
All I need you to know
Is that wherever you go
I'll always be there by your side
'Cause my feelings for you won't subside
Now ya know I wasn't ready to cope
But lookin'back in the past never helped you know
Why am I surrendered by hope She always spoke in a style
Her words were robbing me broke
Thought it true even though
No way to show yeah all the feelings I hold
Not even eye to eye no she could never get it
All she needs is you now I know she never did
Yet after all I've been through she's all I ever wanted
Don't look at me how could I ever be free
She put me under a spell that I could never think of breakin'out of
A hold of my world yeah but I don't know why
She's a hold of my world now and I don't know why
I'm stuck in her web and so I'm saving my breath
Don't gimme sympathy yet see'cause I've done it
Hopin'that I could keep goin'and fool her again
Now wait a minute she's got me in her trap again now
I don't know what it is I wanted to say
I couldn't find words even if I tried anyway
All that I need you to know
Is that wherever you go
I'll always be there by your side
'Cause my feelings for you won't subside
What do you know?
I got a magical flow
I pulled one million dollars right out of my coat
Decided how to spend it
I need to spend it
I think I'll put it down
So I can try to help kids
Living my dreams so I can help you live yours
There's only one big thing and it starts on all 's
Gotta break it down break ya down
'Cause none of this fame helps unless ya got soul
What do you want? Now what is a want?
Ya got people around the world
Who know you're a nonchalant sitting ya down writing it down now
C'mon man there's nothing to it
What do you say we figure out a way?
We help with what we can and stop playing these tricks
We got a one track mind?
Don't let it define you
This is the meaning of magic
I don't know what it is I wanted to say
I couldn't find words even if I tried anyway
All that I need you to know
Is that wherever you go
I'll always be there by your side
'Cause my feelings for you won't subside
I don't know what it is I wanted to say
I couldn't find words even if I tried anyway
All that I need you to know
Is that wherever you go
I'll always be there by your side
'Cause my feelings for you won't subside
