Annabelle's song
Annabelle she lives in a cannon
She'd get fired from anywhere
She's a joke but everybody loves her
She is ugly but she's my friend
She and I go everywhere together
Neither one of us are going nowhere
She was born just around the corner
Never knowing I was there
Annabelle didn't see it coming
When she fell down further than she climbed
She says if you accept it it get's easier
And who knows in time
Maybe we could all unwind
Annabelle loves weekends away
With her boyfriend who is black
She says daddy never would approve
And it's fucked that people think like that
Annabelle didn't see it coming
When she fell down further than she climbed
She says if you accept it it get's easier
And who knows in time
Maybe we could all unwind
Maybe we could all unwind
Maybe we could all unwind
Annabelle says nobody can hurt her
Annabelle says nobody can hurt her
Annabelle says nobody can hurt her
Annabelle says nobody can hurt her
Annabelle says nobody can hurt her
Annabelle says things that she don't mean
Annabelle didn't see it coming
When she fell down further than she climbed
She says if you accept it it gets easier
And who knows in time
Maybe we could all unwind
 All unwind
 Maybe we could all unwind
All unwind
