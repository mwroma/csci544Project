Something new that you've started inside of me
You light me up I feel the fire burning
You take control you want to get away
Somewhere private just you and me
In my t-shirt she's a beauty queen
Don't need no makeup she's my everything
Tonight she asks what she thinks of me
I lay back honestly
Your blue eyes look at me
Your blonde hair covers me
Your red lips are making life
So colourful so beautiful
My whole world was black and white
I can't wait to do it right
Your blue eyes making life
So colourful so beautiful
Something real that I can't bear to loose
You're my diamond I finally found you
I was searching all of my life
Then I stumbled in the rough and you were mine
(Hey) Now making me feel like I'm in clouds（
Never knew love was this loud
Dancing all night to the bass drum
Singing at the top of my lungs
Your blue eyes look at me
Your blonde hair covers me
Your red lips are making life
So colourful so beautiful
My whole world was black and white
I can't wait to do it right
Your blue eyes making life
So colourful so beautiful
(So colourful so beautiful)
Your blue eyes look at me
Your blonde hair covers me
Your red lips are making life
So colourful so beautiful
My whole world was black and white
I can't wait to do it right
Your blue eyes making life
So colourful so beautiful
So colourful so beautiful
Your blue eyes making life
So colourful so beautiful
