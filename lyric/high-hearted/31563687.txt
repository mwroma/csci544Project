Knocking me down doesn't
mean that I won't get up
you know it's hard to beat
something that just won't give up
steady throwing dirt
I just tweak it in the track
threw me to the wolves
came back leadin' the pack
testament to my passion and hustle
rain on my parade and
I'm splashing in the puddles
throwing shade means nothing
I was born in the dark
I made it out the jungle
just a walk in the park
Winning ain't easy
You can ask it any loser
need steady aim
you can ask any shooter
you ain't the homie b
stop friggin' bro in me
knowing about me ain't
the same as knowing me
We come from the dark
and yet we walk in the light
heroes are made
and always down to ride
We are born to fight
we are ninja turtles
Let's all unite let's fight fight
let's fight fight let's all unite
We are born to fight
we are ninja turtles
Let's all unite let's fight fight
let's fight fight let's all unite
you gotta throw them daggers
if you wanna be an MC
choppin' up opposition
screaming TMNT
when you fight for underground
you fighting a  rounds
invaders in trouble now
the lightning is coming down
completely unseen
shadows in the night
my lights are on beam
my sights are on green
hit you with nu jitsu flow so cold
you thinking that the flu hit you
them foes don't know
We come from the dark
and yet we walk in the light
heroes are made and
always down to ride
We are born to fight
we are ninja turtles
Let's all unite let's fight fight
let's fight fight let's all unite
We are born to fight
we are ninja turtles
Let's all unite let's fight fight
let's fight fight let's all unite
we stay winning let's go get it
let's go get it let's go get it
let's get it let's go get it
let's go get it let's go get it
We are born to fight
we are ninja turtles
Let's all unite let's fight fight
let's fight fight let's all unite
We are born to fight
we are ninja turtles
Let's all unite let's fight fight
let's fight fight let's all unite
