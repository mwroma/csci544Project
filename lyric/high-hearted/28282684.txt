Girl it's really good to see you come around
I know you been lost I'm glad you got found
Cause I've been a little lost myself
Found an old picture of you on my phone
Got a new feeling now I won't let go
Til I can I can tell you for myself
Why don't you stay for a while
It's been too long since I've smiled
There's too few people I trust
I won't ask you for too much
Good conversation and such
And if I'm being honest
From time to time
You cross my mind
Good company is hard to find
From time to time
You cross my mind
So stay with me
Just for the night
Got an old record in a beat up sleeve
That same sad song that you sang to me
Back when you couldn't say it for yourself
Look I'd be lying if I said to you
That I know exactly what I should do
But I've set my whole heart on trying
Why don't you stay for a while
It's been too long since I've smiled
There's too few people I trust
I won't ask you for too much
Good conversation and such
And if I'm being honest
From time to time
You cross my mind
Good company is hard to find
From time to time
You cross my mind
So stay with me
Just for the night
From time to time
You cross my mind
Good company is hard to find
From time to time
You cross my mind
So stay with me
Just for the night
(You cross my mind)
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
(You cross my mind)
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
(You cross my mind)
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
(You cross my mind)
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
