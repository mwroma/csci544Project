there're so many things that make me happy
I could go on and on
radishes cabbages holding hands
and gettin packages for my friend John
horses birthdays popsicles
and watching my dog play on the lawn
there're so many things that make me happy
I could go on and on
strawberries barefeet swing sets
watching my baby brother young
climbing trees are not skin in my knees
girls cheese me by Uncle Don
butterflies pretty boats rainbows
and frog sitting on the lawn
there're so many things that make me happy
I could go on and on
when I'm feeling frustrated
mad and just a little bit sad
I can think of my list of happy
and then I get so very glad
there're so many things that make me happy
the list goes on and on
and now I wanna know what makes you happy
I bet your list is just as long
popcorn
cartwheels
baseball
pancakes
turtles
penguin
there're so many things that make me happy
the list goes on and on
so many things that make me happy
I could go on and on
so many things that make me happy
I could go on and on
so many things that make me happy
I could go on and on
I could go on and on
