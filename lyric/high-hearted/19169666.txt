Mama 
Spice Girls
MAMA

She used to be my only enemy and never let me be free
Catching me in places that I knew I shouldn't be
Every other day I crossed the line
I didn't mean to be so bad （harmony）
I never thought you would become the friend I never had
Back then I didn't know why
why you were misunderstood （Mama）
So now I see through your eyes
All that you did was love
Mama I love you
Mama I care
Mama I love you
Mama my friend
You're my friend

I didn't want to hear it then but
I'm not ashamed to say it now
Every little thing you said and did was right for me
I had a lot of time to think about
about the way I used to be
Never had a sense of my responsibility
Back then I didn't know why
why you were misunderstood （Mama）
So now I see through your eyes
All that you did was love
Mama I love you
Mama I care
Mama I love you
Mama my friend
You're my friend

but now I'm sure I know why （I know why）
why you were misunderstood
So now Isee through your eyes
all I can give you is love （all I can give you is love）
Mama I love you
Mama I care
Mama I love you
Mama my friend
Mama I love you
Mama I care
Mama I love you
Mama my friend
You're my friend

Mama I love you
Mama I care
Mama I love you
Mama my friend
Mama I love you
Mama I care
Mama I care
Mama I love you
Mama my friend
Mama I love you
