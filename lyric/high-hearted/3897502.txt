new tomorrow
byimmaculatewhore
Come on boys come on girls
In this crazy crazy world
You're the diamonds you're the pearls
Let's make a new tomorrow today

Wake up slow down do nothing right now
Breathe in breathe out did we forget how
To live to dream and what it all means
It's like we don't care

Who's hot who's not who's got the right upside down
Tonight tomorrow you're out of time
Upstyle you are back in the line
A race to nowhere

Come on boys come on girls
In this crazy crazy world
You're the diamonds you're the pearls
Let's make a new tomorrow
Come on girls come on boys
It's your future it's your choice
And your weapon is your voice
Let's make a new tomorrow today

Turn left turn right don't make up your mind
Your way to fame is all in vain
You get in the spot then you run out of luck
You're going nowhere

We can change it all today!!!

Come on boys come on girls
In this crazy crazy world
You're the diamonds you're the pearls
Let's make a new tomorrow

Come on girls come on boys
It's your future it's your choice
And your weapon is your voice
Let's make a new tomorrow today

(Oooohh o-oh ooooh)
Come on boys
Let's make a new tomorrow

Come on boys come on girls
In this crazy crazy world
You're the diamonds you're the pearls
Let's make a new tomorrow

Come on girls come on boys
It's your future it's your choice
And your weapon is your voice
Let's make a new tomorrow today
