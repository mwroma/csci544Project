I’d like to be what I am
Not an astronaut like nobody
but hey why not
My life is mine and it’s a fact

I’d like to be what I am
Not an astronaut like nobody
but  why not My life is mine and it’s a fact

Wake up in the mornin’
And I picture myself flyin’ in the sky
Cos’ I’m a bird it’s not a lie

Now that I am divin’
Through the oceans of my dreams
I want them so bad to become reality
I’m a daydreamer

I’d like to be what I am
Not an astronaut like nobody
but hey why not
My life is mine and it’s a fact

I’d like to be what I am
Not an astronaut like nobody
but  why not My life is mine and it’s a fact

Wake up in the mornin’
And I picture myself flyin’ in the sky
Cos’ I’m a bird it’s not a lie

Now that I am divin’
Through the oceans of my dreams
I want them so bad to become reality
I’m a daydreamer

I’m a daydreamer
I’m a daydreamer
I’m a daydreamer

I’d like to be what I am
Not an astronaut like nobody
but hey why not
My life is mine and it’s a fact

I’d like to be what I am
Not an astronaut like nobody
but  why not My life is mine and it’s a fact

Wake up in the mornin’
And I picture myself flyin’ in the sky
Cos’ I’m a bird it’s not a lie

Now that I am divin’
Through the oceans of my dreams
I want them so bad to become reality
I’m a daydreamer

I’m a daydreamer
I’m a daydreamer
I’m a daydreamer
I’m a daydreamer
