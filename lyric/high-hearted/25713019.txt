everything in the world
How many times you asked yourself before
What’s the point
wasting time
But how many times you stand up for yourself
Make a point
you have a reason
You know
it’s not fair
Your life
belongs to nobody else
So don’t tell me there is nobody you want to hold
You know you messed up but nobody can live alone
So don’t tell me there is nothing left in this world
Just open your eyes
you got everything in the world
How many times you want to give up yourself
Once again
there’s no point
But how many times you kept on moving on
Once again
you have a reason
You know
it’s not fair
Your life
belongs to nobody else
So don’t tell me there is nobody you want to hold
You know you messed up but nobody can live alone
So don’t tell me there is nothing left in this world
Just open your eyes
you got everything in the world
Does it make you wonder?
Is it karma or is it fate
Is it you
or is it me
Oh does it really make you falter
Does it make you want to believe?
It is true
you’re like nobody else
So don’t tell me there is nobody you want to hold
You know you messed up but nobody can live alone
So don’t tell me there is nothing left in this world
Just open your eyes
you got everything in the world
Just open your eyes
you got everything in the world
I open my eyes
I have you in my world
