Uh It's a big world
It's a big world
Can you feel me
纽约寒冷的天气，上海温暖的回忆，洛城点的飞机，下着小雨的巴黎
拼凑的回忆它像打碎的玻璃，现实和梦镜永远还是有脱离
我忘记，去拿起属于自己的画笔，我忘记怎么去描绘我们的秘密
我说的冒险，你答应过的条件，没收的再见，只剩下那句抱歉
Baby I miss you 在每个无人的夜晚，像循环的单曲，一样的简单
纯白的思念，黑白双色的床单，生命的变换，陶醉了那些片段
A couple seasons passsed me by
Since you made me feel so real
That feeling I remember
It was as good as can be
I haven't seen you for a while
I wonder if you are well
What's going on in your mind?
I really would like to see
谁说时间可以让颜色退变，谁说离开就会一定会被梦见
远走的画面，你在地球的背面，可我总觉得，你还在我的对面
轻轻的忘记她，静静的拥抱她，默默的怀念她，渐渐的离开她
收藏的卡片，过期的电影门票，灰色的背包，照片残留的微笑
还记得你的口头禅和那句话，黑色的深渊好像被无限的放大
我们的距离，它就像昼夜温差，在最寒冷的夏天，做最后挣扎
