It’s sad but you don’t want to say you’re sorry
And you are always right and I am wrong
It’s sad but you keep telling me same story
We’re playing on repeat the same damn song
It’s sad but I don’t think you ever loved me
Oh boy I’m not a prize that you can win
It’s sad but we must stop this crazy party
It’s clear you’re not my king I’m not your queen
I said it’s sad but I’m OK
Maybe tomorrow is a better day
I said it’s sad I’ll be alright
After the rain the sun shines so bright
I said it’s sad but I’m OK
Maybe tomorrow is a better day
I said it’s sad I’ll be alright
After the rain the sun shines so bright
It’s sad but I don’t wanna start all over
Again another game another lie
It’s sad but I must tell you that it’s over
Oh baby now it’s time to say goodbye
It’s sad but we became just two more strangers
And our story has no happy end
It’s sad but I think now it’s time for changes
And I wish all the best to you my friend
I said it’s sad but I'm OK
Maybe tomorrow is a better day
I said it’s sad I’ll be alright
After the rain the sun shines so bright
I said it’s sad but I'm OK
Maybe tomorrow is a better day
I said it’s sad I’ll be alright
After the rain the sun shines so bright
I said it’s sad but I'm OK
Maybe tomorrow is a better day
I said it’s sad I’ll be alright
After the rain the sun shines so bright
I said it’s sad but I'm OK
Maybe tomorrow is a better day
I said it’s sad I’ll be alright
After the rain the sun shines so bright
I said it’s sad but I'm OK
Maybe tomorrow is a better day
I said it’s sad I’ll be alright
After the rain the sun shines so bright
