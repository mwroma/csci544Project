Have you been to California
Seen the sights and people there
Walked the streets of sleepy sea towns
Tasted salty ocean air

Once I flew to New York City
Took my picture in Time Square
Soho nights and Broadway lights
Such a pity you weren't there
Pack your bags and lock your door
I'll take you places you've not been before
All I've ever wished to do is
Travel through this life with you

Make your way to London England
Paris France is also nice
Ooh la la when people say hello
They kiss your cheeks three times
Pack your bags and lock your door
I'll take you places you've not been before
All I've ever wished to do is
Travel through this life with you
Monte Carlo is awaiting
Bombay intoxicating
The sky in Bora Bora is
The color of your eyes
Pack your bags and lock your door
I'll take you places you've not been before
All I've ever wished to do is
Travel through this life with you
Pack your bags and lock your door
I'll take you places you've not been before
All I've ever wished to do is
Travel through this life with you
