I get dressed up in my winter clothes
And step outside to look at the roses
But they're all covered in the morning snow
Just open your heart
And the world will carry you home tonight
It will

I get dressed up in my summer clothes
And step outside to look at the roses
But they're all covered in their sharper thorns
Just open your eyes
And the world will follow you home tonight

It will

Let's put on our rain coats
And drench ourselves in english weather
Just to know we're free
We'll bury our heads down beneath the old oak tree
Just you and me

But please
Oh now take this broken heart of mine

It's the only beat that I have left
Just pulsing through this empty chest

And I don't know where I should begin
I get dressed up in my autumn clothes
And step out side to pick up the leaves in
I can not believe the whole year has gone
I open my arms to embrace you
It's time to go right back to the start

Let's put on our rain coats
And drench ourselves in english weather
Just to know we're free
We'll bury our heads down beneath the old oak tree
Just you and me
But please
Oh now take this broken heart of mine
It's the only beat that I have left
Just pulsing through this empty chest
And I don't know where I should begin
