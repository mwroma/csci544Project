Take me to the place
I used to run
Remember the house where I was born
My baby you don't know me
My baby you don't know

I'll show you all the stars
I used to hide
No one ever seem to realize
But baby you will know me
But baby you will know

But baby you will know
But baby  you don't know

But baby  you don't know
But baby  you don't know

Take me to the place
I used to run
Remember the house where I was born
My baby you don't know me
My baby you don't know

I'll show you all the stars
I used to hide
No one ever seem to realize
But baby you will know me
But baby you will know

My baby you don't know
My baby you don't know

My baby you don't know
My baby you don't know
My baby you don't know
