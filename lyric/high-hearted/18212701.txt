Bitty boppy Betty
Bitty boppy Betty
Bitty boppy Betty boo-boo
On weekends she's your honey
Then comes Monday
And that'll be "Sir" to you
Bitty boppy Betty
Better known as Billy
He's the up'n'coming local DA
A fearless crime fighter
Political insider
Sure to be mayor one day
But after work on Fridays
Off comes his necktie
And on come her diamonds and pearls
You better get ready
'Cause now Billy's Betty
Everybody's favorite girl
The underbelly of the city
That's where you'll find Betty
Friday to Sunday night
Is she working undercover
Or just a fun-lover?
Either way that's alright!
Bitty boppy Betty
What a bouncy beauty
So sophisticated and refined
She's a boy who doesn't show it
And though the guys all know it
None of them seems to mind
When Betty starts a-boppin'
The joint starts a hoppin'
She can twist and bend
The whole night through
You really can't ignore her
And if you don't adore her
There might be something wrong with you
On Mondays bright and early
Betty's back to Billy
Working hard on behalf of our town
Upholding law and order
Talking to reporters
And keeping us safe and sound
If there's a moral to this ditty
It's not to judge Betty
Billy or anyone
'Cause life's a lot richer
With a healthy mixture
Not to mention lots more fun!
Bitty boppy Betty
Bitty boppy Betty
Bitty boppy Betty boo-boo
On weekends she's your honey
Then comes Monday
And that'll be "Sir" to you
