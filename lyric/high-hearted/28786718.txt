You went walking away
into the sun
How romantic
I knew we were done
Was it something I said
something I did
It must be over my head
I didn't quite understand it
Now it's out of my hands
it's out of my hands
I'm sorry for the way
you must feeling about yourself
everyday
Baby you needed me to make it
so you could keep on running away
Was it something I said
something I did
It must be over my head
I didn't quite understand it
Now it's out of my hands
It's out of my hands
When it feels like
life has gotten out of control
When it feels like
there's much too much to hold
When it feels like
too much to understand
No that's out of your hands
Out of your hands
Out of your hands
No that's out of your hands
Out of your hands
Out of your hands
Was it something I said
something I did
It must be over my head
I didn't quite understand it
Now it's out of my hands
It's out of my hands
When it feels like
life has gotten out of control
When it feels like
there's much too much to hold
When it feels like
too much to understand
No that's out of your hands
Out of your hands
Out of your hands
No that's out of your hands
Out of your hands
Out of your hands
