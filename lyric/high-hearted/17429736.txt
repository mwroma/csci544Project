5 Years Time
 作曲  Fink
Oh well'
In  years time we could be walking around a zoo
With the sun shining down over me and you
and there'll be love in the bodies of the elephants too
Put my hands over your eyes' but you peek through

And there'll be'
Sun Sun Sun'
All over our bodies'
and Sun Sun Sun'
All down our necks'
and there'll be'
Sun Sun Sun'
All over our faces'
and Sun Sun Sun

So what the heck'
Coz' I'll be laughing at all your silly little jokes'
And we'll be laughing about how we used to smoke
All those stupid little ciggarettes and drink stupid wine'
Cuz' it was what we needed to have a good time

And it was'
Fun Fun Fun
When we were drinking
It was'
Fun Fun Fun
When we were drunk
And it was'
Fun Fun Fun
When we were laughing'
It was'
Fun Fun Fun'
Oh it was fun

Oh well I look at you and say it's the happiest I have ever been
and I'll say I feel I no longer have to be James Dean'
and She'll say'
Oh yeah' Well I feel pretty happy too'
And I'm always pretty happy when I'm just kicking back with you

and it will be
Love Love Love
All through our bodies
Love Love Love
All through our minds
and it'd be
Love love Love
All over her face
and Love Love Love
All over mine

And in the oddest moments and just scratching my head
I'll be thinking about families n' lying in bed
Even though I believe it may not even come true
But in my mind I'm having a pretty good time with you

Oh' Five years time
I might not know you'
In Five Years Time
We might not speak at all and
In Five Years Time
We might not get along
In Five Years Time
You might just prove me wrong

Oh there'll be'
Love Love Love
Where ever you go' There'll be
Love Love Love
Where ever you go' There'll be
Love Love Love
Where ever you go' There'll be
Love Love Love
Where ever you go' There'll be
Love Love Love
Where ever you go' There'll be
Love Love Love
Where ever you go' There'll be
Love Love Love
Where ever you go' There'll be
Love Love Love
Where ever you go' There'll be
Love
