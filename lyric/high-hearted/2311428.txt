The other night dear as I lay sleeping
I dreamed I held you in my arms
 when I awoke dear I was mistaken
and I hung my head and I cried
You are my sunshine my only sunshine
You make me happy when skies are gray
You'll never know dear how much I love you
Please don't take my sunshine away
You told me once dear you really loved me
And no one else could come between
But not you've left me and love another;
You have shattered all of my dreams
You are my sunshine my only sunshine
You make me happy when skies are gray
You'll never know dear how much I love you
Please don't take my sunshine away
You'll never know dear how much I love you
Please don't take my sunshine away
