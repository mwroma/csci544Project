Lost in the day in a way
It's the same a the one before this
And I wish I could say
That's it's all black and white
But it's grey it's the same
It's the same and I'm so tired
But you are what I'm coming home to

Oh and I'm thinking abouta a red wine buzz and takin' it easy
And I got you in my arms takin' a break from crazy

And I'll say hey you'll say baby how's ur day
I'll say crazy but it's all gonna be alright
You'll kiss my smile I'll pull you closer spend a while
Just getting to know ya but it's gonna be all alright
I'm loving you tonight loving you tonight

And you are there on my heart at the start
Of my every morning and I can't deny
By the end of the day that I'm running on empty
But you make me full steal my breath
You're so unpredictable that's what I'm coming home to

Oh I'm dreaming about a romance slow dancing with you
When I got you in arms I don't care what we do
Every day is just the in-between
The hours separating you from me
I know you'll be waiting I know you'll be waiting
