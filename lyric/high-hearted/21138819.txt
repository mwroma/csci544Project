I wonder if she's here with someone
A girl like that can get attention
I could just go walking her way
All I've got to do is figure out the words I need to say
Woo ooh woo ooh I just need an introduction
Woo ooh woo ooh I keep coming up with nothing
Woo ooh woo ooh Why do I lose my voice and choke
When all I wanna say is
Hey hey I gotta be with you
Hey hey You're beautiful in every Way way
So what I need to say is Hey hey
And change the world in a day

In your eyes I see you're lonely
Look at me I want you only
We belong together this I know
Just gotta find the words to tell you so
Woo ooh woo ooh I just need an introduction
Woo ooh woo ooh I keep coming up with nothing
Woo ooh woo ooh Why do I lose my voice and choke
When all I wanna say is
Hey hey I gotta be with you
Hey hey You're beautiful in every Way way
So what I need to say is Hey hey
And change the world in a day

I have my lines and story set
You look at me and I forget
Thoughts are running through my head
Jumbled up and left unsaid

Woo ooh woo ooh I just need an introduction
Woo ooh woo ooh I keep coming up with nothing
Woo ooh woo ooh Why do I lose my voice and choke
When all I wanna say is
Hey hey I gotta be with you
Hey hey
Hey hey So what I need to say is Hey hey
And change the world in a day
