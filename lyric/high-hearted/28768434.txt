I woke up with my face in the sunlight
I could be in Rome or in London town
I can feel the taste of the good life
I feel the statue in Rio
Taking on the world with my arms wide out
Pocket full of dreams that are real
Time to run away
We're already late
So we better start today
Dancing to the drum
No matter where we're from
You know that your life won't wait
If you wanna take a ride
Go ahead
Go ahead
Gotta learn living life
Go ahead
Go ahead
Don't matter who's on top
Together we won't stop
Promise we will be alright
Gotta learn living life
Go ahead
Go ahead
Put em in the air air air air
Hands in the air air air air
Put em in the air air air air
Hands in the air air air air
Put em in the air air air air
Hands in the air air air air
Put em in the air air air air
Hands in the air air air air
You wanna be a rock or a mountain
Lying on the dirt or above the clouds
Sick of all the shit that we're chained in
Time to run away
We're already late
So we better start today
Dancing to the drum
No matter where we're from
You know that your life won't wait
If you wanna take a ride
Go ahead
Go ahead
Gotta learn living life
Go ahead
Go ahead
Don't matter who's on top
Together we won't stop
Promise we will be alright
Gotta learn living life
Go ahead
Go ahead
Put em in the air air air air
Hands in the air air air air
Put em in the air air air air
Hands in the air air air air
Put em in the air air air air
Hands in the air air air air
Put em in the air air air air
Hands in the air air air air
Don't matter who's on top
Together we won't stop
Promise we will be alright
Gotta learn living life
Go ahead
Go ahead
Put em in the air air air air
Hands in the air air air air
Put em in the air air air air
Hands in the air air air air
Put em in the air air air air
Hands in the air air air air
Put em in the air air air air
Hands in the air air air air
