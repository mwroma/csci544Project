 作词  Wanting Qu
Another sunrise another sunset
Soon it'll all be yesterday
Another good day another bad day
What did you do today?
Why do we choose to chase what we'll lose?
What you want isn't what you have
What you have may not be yours to keep
If I could find love at a stop in a park with open arms
I would save all my love in a jar
made of sparks sealed in my beating heart
Could it be yours to keep the Jar of Love
Another left turn another head turns
Could he be someone I deserve?
Another right turn another lesson learned
Never leave an open flame to burn
Why do we choose to chase what we'll lose?
What you want isn't what you have
What you have may not be yours to keep
If I could find love
at a stop in a park with open arms
I would save all my love
in a jarmade of sparks
sealed in my beating heart
Could it be yours to keep the Jar of Love
Could you be my love
Could you be my love
Could you be my love
Could you be my love
Could you be her love
Could you be his love
Could you be my love
Could I be you love
If I could find love
at a stop in a park with open arms
I would save all my love
in a jarmade of sparks
sealed in my beating heart
Could it be yours to keep
If I could find love
at a stop in a park with open arms
I would save all my love
in a jarmade of sparks
sealed in my beating heart
Could it be yours to keep
If I could find love
at a stop in a park with open arms
I would save all my love
in a jarmade of sparks
sealed in my beating heart
Could it be yours to keep
the Jar of Love
Could it be yours to keep
the Jar of Love
Could it be yours to keep
the Jar of Love
