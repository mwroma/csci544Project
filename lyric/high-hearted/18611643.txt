i'm yours
Well you done done me and you bet I felt it
I tried to be chill but you're so hot that I melted
I fell right through the cracks
and now I'm trying to get back
Before the cool done run out
I'll be giving it my bestest
Nothing's going to stop me but divine intervention
I reckon its again my turn to win some or learn some
But I won't hesitate no more no more
It cannot wait I'm yours
Well open up your mind and see like me
Open up your plans and damn you're free
Look into your heart and you'll find love love love love
Listen to the music of the moment people dance and sing
We're just one big family
It's your God-forsaken right to be loved love loved love love
So I won't hesitate no more no more
It cannot wait I'm sure
There's no need to complicate
Our time is short
This is our fate I'm yours
do do do do you but do you do do do
But do you want to come on
Scooch on over closer dear
And i will nibble your ear
I've been spending way too long checking my tongue in the mirror
And bending over backwards just to try to see it clearer
but My breath fogged up the glass
And so I drew a new face and laughed
I guess what i'ma saying is there ain't no better reason
To rid yourself of vanity and just go with the seasons
It's what we aim to do
Our name is our virtue
But I won't hesitate no more no more
It cannot wait I'm yours
Open up your mind and see like me (I won't hesitate)
Open up your plans and damn you're free (No more no more)
Look into your heart and you'll find the sky is yours (It cannot wait I'm sure)
So please don't please don't please don't (There's no need to complicate)
There's no need to complicate (Our time is short)
Coz our time is short (This is our fate)
This is this is this is our fate
I'm yours
