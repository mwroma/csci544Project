Don't you don't you step on a snake
Don't you don't you ride a plant
Don't you don't you eat a steak
It might kill you
Don't you don't you Stay in the sun
Don't you don't you open the door
Don't you don't you Have any fun
It will kill you
If you want to get to the end of the day
Before you die here's what I say
lay down stay down cause you can't fall off the floor
Who's afraid of the big bad world
The big bad world
The big bad world
Who's afraid of the big bad world
Nobody loves a chicken
Who's afraid of the big bad world
The big bad world
The big bad world
Who's afraid of the big bad world
Get some guts and feel no fear
Don't you don't you sit on a wall
Don't you don't you take a breath
Don't you don't you answer the call
It might kill you
Don't you don't you catch a cold
Don't you don't you say what you think
Don't you don't you ever get old
It will kill you
If you want to get to the end of the day
Before you die here's what I say
lay down stay down cause you can't fall off the floor

Get some guts and feel no fear
Play it safe

Life is truly wonderful but slippery when wet
stay inside
stay and hide
life can give you everything but don't forget stay low
