Just you and me
 作曲  Avi
You were sitting at the coffee table
where you’re reading Kierkegaard

Minutes later' you proceeded to say
something that almost broke my heart

You said' “Darling' I am tired of
livin’ my routined life

There’s so much in the world that i’d like
to soak up with my eyes”

Well' baby I never did stop you
from going out to explore

We can do it all together
from the colds of the poles
to the tropics of Borneo

Ba da da ba da…

Let’s pack our bags

and lie on the easy stream

feel the water on our backs

where we can carry on dreamin’
where we can finally

be where we’d like to be
Darlin’' just you and me

Just you and me…


Does that sound like a plan to you?

We can build our own little world
Darlin’' what do you say?So
where no one can come through

We can live in huts made out of grass
we can greet father time as he walks pass
we can press feet into the dirt
a little mud' no' it wouldn’t hurt

Ba da da ba da ba…
Let’s pack our bags
and lie on the easy stream

feel the water on our backs
where we can carry on dreamin’
where we can finally

be where we’d like to be
Darlin’' just you and me

Just you and me
