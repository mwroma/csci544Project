 Last Christmas I gave you my heart
 But the very next day you gave it away
 This year to save me from tears
 Ill give it to someone special
 Last Christmas I gave you my heart

 But the very next day you gave it away
 This year to save me from tears
 Ill give it to someone special

 Once bitten and twice shy
 I keep my distance but you still catch my eye
 Tell me baby do you recognize me?
 Well its been a year it doesnt surprise me
 Happy Christmas

 I wrapped it up and sent it
 With a note saying I love you I meant it
 Now I know what a fool Ive been
 But if you kissed me now I know youd fool me again
 Last Christmas I gave you my heart

 But the very next day you gave it away
 This year to save me from tears
 Ill give it to someone special
 Last Christmas I gave you my heart

 But the very next day you gave it away
 This year to save me from tears
 Ill give it to someone special special
  A crowded room friends with tired eyes
 Im hiding from you and your soul of ice
 My God I thought you were someone to rely on
 Me I guess I was a shoulder to cry on
  A face on a lover with a fire in her heart
 A man undercover but you tore me apart

 Now Ive found a real love
 Youll never fool me again
 Last Christmas I gave you my heart
 But the very next day you gave it away
 This year to save me from tears
 Ill give it to someone special
 Last Christmas I gave you my heart
