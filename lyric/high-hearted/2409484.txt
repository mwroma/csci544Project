hello my love 
Hello my love
Been sleeping once again
Rise up sunshine
Its time to wake up
Stop your thinking
Come to be and
Take my hand and
We'll be moving
Following you following me
Its been way to long
Da dadadada
Da da dadada
Da dadadada
Da da dadada
Hello my love
Our smiles will lead the way
Ready set go
New eyes to see through
Have a notion
Swing full motion
Jump with me
Into the ocean
Following you following me
Its been way to long
Da dadadada
Da da dadada
Da dadadada
Da da dadada
A brand new light is coming round
A brand new light is coming around
Come on now and just take my hand
My new friend
And we'll sing
Hello my love
The wind is flowing in
Reach out hold tight
We're on our way now
To open spaces
Learning faces
Come with me now
Discover places
Following you following me
Its been way to long
Da dadadada
Da da dadada
Da dadadada
Da da dadada
