arThis Century
 HaHa a~~
You are the definition of a shooting star
Somewhere in the atmosphere
Then you went ahead and disappeared
I know I got lost in the afterglow
Waiting on the stars to show in your eyes
I want to start believing in a world out there
Something that this love could not compare to
You and I both know
I could put you in the sunshine hoping for the daylight
But you say "no way I'm not going out there"
You could play it back real slow until you hear an echo
All I wanted was you at my side
Why you gotta run why you gotta run and hide?
Heaven only knows that I want you there
To kiss you in the midnight air
I could tell you what you want to hear
And we'd go far away from everything you know
If you could only let it go let it go
I could put you in the sunshine hoping for the daylight
But you say "no way I'm not going out there"
You could play it back real slow until you hear an echo
All I wanted was you at my side
Why you gotta run why you gotta run and hide?
I don't know think you know
I don't know think you know how far I'd go for you
I don't think you see all that we could be
But I can't go and make you fall for me
No I can't make you fall for me
I could put you in the sunshine hoping for the daylight
But you say "no way I'm not going out there"
You could play it back real slow until you hear an echo
All I wanted was you at my side
Why you gotta run why you gotta run and hide?
