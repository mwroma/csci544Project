Stay Here Forever
Oh（Oh） Oh（Oh） Oh Oh
I'm laying here dreaming Staring at the ceiling
Wasting the day away
The world's flying by our window outside
But hey baby thats OK
This feels so right it can't be wrong
So far as I can see
Where you wanna go baby
I'll do anything
Cause if you wanna go Baby let's go
If you wanna rock on ready to roll
And if you wanna slow down
We can slow down together
If you wanna walk Baby let's walk
Have a little kiss have a little talk
We don't gotta leave at all
We can lay here forever
Stay here forever
Oh Oh Oh Oh
If you wanna see that Italian tower leaning
Baby we can leave right now
If that's too far
We can jump in the car and take a little trip around town
They say that California is nice and warm this time of year
Baby say the word and we'll just disappear
Cause if you wanna go Baby let's go
If you wanna rock on ready to roll
And if you wanna slow down
We can slow down together
If you wanna walk Baby let's walk
Have a little kiss have a little talk
We don't gotta leave at all
We can lay here forever
Stay here forever
Oh It's a big world for a boy and a girl
Letting go of it all
Holding on to one another
Oh there's a whole lot of world to discover
Under the covers
So if you wanna go Baby lets go
If you wanna rock I'm ready to roll
If you wanna slow down
We can slow down together
If you wanna walk Baby lets walk
Have a little kiss have a little talk
We don't gotta leave at all
We can lay here forever
Stay here forever
Let's just lay here forever
Stay here forever
Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh
