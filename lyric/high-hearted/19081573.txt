until you
 作词  BIRGISSON ARNTHOR/KOTECHA SAVAN/YACOUB RAMI
Baby life was good to me
But you just made it better
I love the way you stand by me
Throught any kind of weather
I dont wanna run away
Just wanna make your day
When you fell the world is on your shoulders
Dont wanna make it worse
Just wanna make us work
Baby tell me i will do whatever
It feels like nobody ever knew me until you knew me
Feels like nobody ever loved me until you loved me
Feels like nobody ever touched me until you touched me
Baby nobody nobodyuntil you
Baby it just took one hit of you now I'm addicted
You never know what's missing
Till you get everything you needyeah
I don't wanna run away
Just wanna make your day
When you feel the world is on your shoulders
Don't wanna make it worse
Just wanna make us work
Baby tell meI'll do whatever
It feels like nobody ever knew me until you knew me
Feels like nobody ever loved me until you loved me
Feels like nobody ever touched me until you touched me
Babynobodynobody until you
See it was enough to no
If I ever let you go
I would be no one
Cos I never thought I'd feel all the things you made me feel
Wasn't looking for someone until you
It feels like nobody ever knew me until you knew me
Feels like nobody ever loved me until you loved me
Feels like nobody ever touched me until you touched me
Babynobodynobody
It feels like nobody ever knew me until you knew me
Feels like nobody ever loved me until you loved me
Feels like nobody ever touched me until you touched me
Babynobodynobody
Nobodynobodyuntil you
