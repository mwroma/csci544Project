sunny day
I open my eyes
I look to the sky
it's a sunny day
the world is looking so bright
what a surprise
it's a sunny day
oh oh oh oh oh ohooo
Gimme Gimme Gimme Gimme what I want
I want sunshine sunshine
Gimme Gimme Gimme cuz it's been so long
I want sunshine sunshine
I'm feeling so free
like a summer breeze
It must be magic
I forget all my plans
put my toes in the sand
I just can't help it
oh oh ooh oh ohhh
Gimme Gimme Gimme Gimme what I want
I want sunshine sunshine
Gimme Gimme Gimme cuz it's been so long
I want sunshine sunshine
we're two of a kind
like blue birds singing out a simple tune
if you don't mind
it's the perfect kind of day to fall in love
with you
oh oh ooh oh ohhh
Gimme Gimme Gimme Gimme what I want
I want sunshine sunshine
Gimme Gimme Gimme cuz it's been so long
I want sunshine sunshine
oh oh ooh oh ohhh
