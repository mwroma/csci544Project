We're packing our suites to travel
We'll step out the border
Stop beeing just clubbers
We'll fly to antoher place than Ibiza
where everbody'd live and care for the others
and life is much cooler
I can feel deep love across the seas
So u and me
Let's go to Bamako
Let's go to Bamako
We're taking a chance to clean up
Our past and frozen Karma
We need a loving shelter
We're gonna do some Yoga
And dance in Africa
Where everbody's live in peace
and a neighbor is not just a stranger
I can see the stardsup in the sky
Teel u and me
Let's go to Bamako
Let's go to Bamako
We're gonna take some time for celebration
From Rio de Janeiro to San Diego
Community is sharing love and joy
SydneyTokyoParis Bamako again
Let's go to Bamako OH OH OH
Let's go to Bamako OH OH OH
Let's go to Bamako OH OH OH
Let's go to Bamako OH OH OH
Let's go to Bamako

Let's go to Bamako
