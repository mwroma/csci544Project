 sometimes you wonder
 what if you could rewrite the moment
 Sometimes you figure out
 theres another luck in imperfection
 Sometimes youve been hurt
 then you learn to think about and feel more
 Sometimes youve been bored
 with the life you hate
 always be amazed
 always take a risk
 always keep the pace in a lifetime game
 
 life is rolling the dice
 babe
 you can not imagine what would happen in a second
 
 life is rolling the dice
 babe
 while youre lost in the dark
 close your eyes
 youll find the lights shine in the other side
