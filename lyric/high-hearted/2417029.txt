Numb Encore
I become so numb`（haha）
Can I get an encore
Do you want more?
I become so numb`
Can I get an encore
Do you want more?
Get your ass up for the doctor
One more time get your ass up for the doctor
Come on now here we go
Cliff hanger it's another club banger
Got you hangin' on the edge of your seat
Get on down
Time's up
Ooh yeah
bout to show these knuckleheads how to do this here
Ooh yeah new year next phase begin
Look who's got you goin' crazy again
I'm a trend I set one every time I'm in
I go out and just come back full circle again
You a fad that means your something that we already had
But once you're gone
you don't come back too bad
You're off the map now radar can't even find you
We stay on the grind you slip we out-grind you
You walk around mad you let your anger blind you
We walk around just playin' the violin behind you
Enough with all the pissin' and moanin' whinin' and bitchin'
Sit and observe listen you'll learn if you pay attention
Why ten multi-platinum albums later three diamond
World-wide we're on the charts with a bullet and still climbin'（for DESE GENERATIONS```）
Can I get an encore
Do you want more
Cooking raw with the Brooklyn boy
So for one last time I need y'all to roar
Now what the hell are you waiting for
After me there shall be no more
So for one last time nigga make some noise
So all my people on the left all my people on the right
Scream one last time
When dr dre say crunk you will get it crunk get it crunk
Crunk crunk crunk
And when  cent says jump you get on what and jump
Jump jump jump jump
The buzz is tremendous we drop you all to sense it
I don't gotta promote it for you to know that doc is off the benches
We keep the party rockin' off the henges
We ain't showin' off we just goin' off popular consensus
But critics say that Doc is soft Doc is talk
Doc is all washed up knock it off
Who the fuck is Doc impressin'?
Doc is this Doc is that you got the wrong impression
You must be on the cock of Doc cuz Doc left you all guessin'
So DJ take the needle and just drop it on the record （what）
We gon' have this mutherfucker hoppin' in a second （bump bump）
That's why we always save the best cut last
To make you scratch and itch for it like fresh cut grass
Cuz we done swam with the sharks wrestle with alligators
Spoke to a generation of angry teenagers
Whom if it wasn't for rap to bridge the gap
Maybe raised to be racist
Who may have never got to see our faces
Grace the cover of Rolling Stone pages
Broke down barriers of language and races
Just call on the cape crusaders
And leave it to me and Dre to pass the mic
And we can play the back and forth all day
Like the hot potato game thats why we came to
First we came here to set this party off right
Let's bounce tonight
Now what the hell are you waiting for
After me there shall be no more
So for one last time nigga make some noise
I become so numb
So for one last time I need y'all to roar
One last time I need y'all to roar
Every step that I take is another mistake to you
（Caught in the undertow just caught in the undertow）
And every second I waste is more than I can take
I become so numb I can feel you there
Become so tired so much more aware
I becoming this all I want to do
Is be more like me and be less like you
I've become so numb
Can I get an encore
Do you want more
Bounce now hands up you know how we do
We make the club jump everywhere we go
It's no secret everybody know
When Dre's involved there's plenty money involved
And plenty honey's involved the sunny Sunday's and palm trees
Cali everyday it's just another party from the valley's
All the way to them  Mile alleys let's rally
Hands up for the grand finale
Now raise up out your seat Dre is about to speak
Blaze a pound of weed six days up out the week
You could catch me in the studio bangin' out the beats to
Provide you with the heat that keep blazin' out your speaker
So nervous ain't never cuz Shady Aftermath together
Along with G-Unit Records presents the return of the-the Doc （and Shady）
No one could do it better
We tear the club up and leave without a strand of evidence and uh
Can I get an encore
Do you want more
Cooking raw with the Brooklyn boy
So for one last time I need y'all to roar
I become so numb
So for one last time I need y'all to roar
One last time I need y'all``````
