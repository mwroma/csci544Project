Yo picture this
U got a kid in a room
his hands sweatin and shakin while he's lacin his shoes
the excitement's buildin up for what's comin up soon
To get there and do what he was born to do

他拥有篮球梦
他成为地狱修罗
他知道全盘战局只能够靠自己掌控
虽感到一点疲倦
虽感到一些危险
但是在胜负分明之前绝对不会退却

Cuz now he's out on the floor
And he's catchin the pass
slashin to the glass movin so fast right to the hole
they don't know how to stop him
and he keeps on droppin
's and 's by the second
and the crowd is rockin
so they knock him
躺在冰冷地上
只要一个深呼吸就能再冲刺全场
慢动作的世界
欢呼声蜂拥如浪
就在一分钟
过后强者加冕称王

让绝对无敌的传说
能永远不会被打破
必须要战斗 my way
if I'm ever gonna get back
get back get back

让绝对无敌的传说

Yo imagine
有个女孩出现
她在人群之中永远都是第一耀眼
她总是在身边
不知心里想谁
所有男孩梦想有天能给她全世界

But the truth
is that there's someone on the other team
Someone who stole her heart
Someone who holds her dreams
They kiss for the st time just the other evening
Her brother's  but her lover's number 

战况激烈 好戏正要上演
女孩不知道自己应该站哪一边
眼神交汇 局势瞬息万变
大家都屏住呼吸忍住不眨眼

 on the break
 on the chase
Brother goes in the air with brother up in his face
They come crashing to the dirt
Tears about to burst
When the game is over who she gonna run to first yo

让绝对无敌的传说
能永远不会被打破
必须要战斗 my way
if I'm ever gonna get back
get back get back

让绝对无敌的传说
能永远记住在心中

有时感觉阻碍太多
但我还是为了我的
梦想而战斗
Nothin's gonna stop me

Ey yo this game of life is one big struggle
We gotta hustle just to make it everyday
and to find ourselves a way
to fight the fears we facin
and grab those dreams we chasin
cuz there ain't no competition
when we rise to the occasion c'mon

让绝对无敌的传说
能永远不会被打破
必须要战斗 my way
if I'm ever gonna get back
get back get back
让绝对无敌的传说
能永远记住在心中
必须要战斗 my way
if I'm ever gonna get back hey~~
