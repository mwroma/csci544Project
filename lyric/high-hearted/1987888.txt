I love you
There was once a broken man
Who walked a lonely road
And Gave up all his dreams
I was once this broken man
Stared into the sun
and Just refuse to see
I was
lost amongst the clouds that would'nt fade
I was looking for an answer
I was searching but I didn’t take the time
I was down and out and feeling so afraid
I love you
the Way that you turn me round
And chase away my blues
I love you
the way that you change my world
when I’m with you
Love may come and love may go
but now its here to stay
Forever and a day
And when I See you smile
I fall into your eyes
to Never fade away
I need you hear to make the dark clouds drift away
And to make the mornings bright again
I’m right here for you theres nothing more to say
i'm just happy you are mine you've stayed
I love you
the Way that you turn me round
And chase away my blues
I love you
the way that you change my world
when I’m with you
It doesn’t matter where we're from and where we are going
as long as your with me all the way
And the nights are long and lonely and
I’m waking up
to find a brighter day
I love you
the Way that you turn me round
And chase away my blues
I love you
the way that you change my world
when I’m with you
