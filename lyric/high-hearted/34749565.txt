 You
Used to step back
And watch yourself fall
Afraid to dream out loud in the night
You
You just couldn't see
The chance that you could be
The one that shines like star in the sky
Now the heat is rising
Rage is burning inside
You know you're one of a kind
You get what you wanted
Big up amaze me
Big up against me
Light up the sky
Light up your life
Show them the strength in you
Big up inflame me
Big up embrace me
Light up the sky
Light up your life
Never hold back your fire
You
You just couldn't see
The chance that you could be
The one that shines like star in the sky
Now the heat is rising
Rage is burning inside
You know you're one of a kind
You get what you wanted
Big up amaze me
Big up against me
Light up the sky
Light up your life
Show them the strength in you
Big up inflame me
Big up embrace me
Light up the sky
Light up your life
Never hold back your fire
Break up chains and everything else
You can make it through the places you want to step on
Come on you can shine
You
Used to step back
And watch yourself fall
But now you know you can
Big up amaze me
Big up against me
Light up the sky
Light up your life
Show them the strength in you
Big up inflame me
Big up embrace me
Light up the sky
Light up your life
Never hold back your fire
