tiGood day
offset
Hey！
Today is a good day to be alive
Give me a second
and I'll tell you all the reasons why
Got up on the right side of bed and I
Put on brand new clothes looking superfly
It is this girl that I want
Tonight she says she's alone
Today is just that day
ohh
It's like my song
song is playing everywhere
that i go
I don't know
why why some days they turn out
being my show
I got this good good feeling guess
it's something I did
No need to sympathize
No no no
Today's a good day to be alive~ be alive~
Today's a good day to be alive~ be alive~
hey
I take a walk on the smile side
Everywhere I go I'm in the limelight
Ran past my ex a couple of blocks away
She'd gotten fat and ugly
Glad I didn't stay
I'm on my way to a date
I guess there's something called fate
Today is just that day
ohh
It's like my song
song is playing everywhere
that i go
I don't know
why why some days they turn out
being my show
I got this good good feeling guess
it's something I did
No need to sympatthize
No no no
Today's a good day to be alive
Today's a good day to be alive
It's like my song
song is playing everywhere
that i go
I don't know
why why some days they turn out
being my show
I got this good good feeling guess
it's some thing i did
No need to sympatthize
No no no
Today's a good day to be alive
Ah ah a-ah ah ah~
Today's a good day to be alive
Ah ah a-ah ah ah~
Today's a good day to be alive
Ah ah a-ah ah ah~
Today's a good day to be alive
Ah ah a-ah ah ah~
It's like my song
song is playing everywhere
that i go
I don't know
why why some days they turn out
being my show
I got this good good feeling guess
it's something I did
No need to sympatthize
No no no
Today's a good day to be alive
Ah ah a-ah ah ah~
Today's a good day to be alive
