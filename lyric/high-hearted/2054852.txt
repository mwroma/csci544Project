Life is beautiful it's true
When I balance what I do
And enjoy the world in front of me
And it's time to get away
This is a good time to get away to the good life
To get away on this perfect day
I'm gonna take time to work inside of the city
Or play all day in the country this is the good life
I can't help the way I feel
And I know that this is real
The sun is smiling down upon my face
I am filled up to the brim
And I just can't hold it in
So I laugh out loud and tell the world
It's time to get away
This is a good time to get away to the good life
To get away on this perfect day
I'm gonna take time to work inside of the city
Or play all day in the country this is the good life
This is a good time to get away to the good life
To get away on this perfect day
I'm gonna take time to work inside of the city
Or play all day in the country this is the good life
