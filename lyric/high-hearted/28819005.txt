 anytime I look up at the stars
I remember which ones you said with us
no one told me this would be so hard
cause I feel like im million miles away
tonight its like im million miles away
everywhere I go
im thinking about you
just want you to know
im thinking about you
New York or London
no matter where I been
the one thing that helps me get through
its thinking about you
oh~~~~oh~~~~~oh~~~~~
its thinking about you
oh~~~~oh~~~~oh~~~~
its been a little crazy  I know
ant it not different time zones
wishing  I  was on  my way back home
cause I
feel like ima million miles away
tonight
its like ima million miles away
everywhere I go
im thinking about you
just want you to know
 im thinking about you
New York or London
no matter where I been
the one thing that helps me get through
its thinking about you
oh~~~~oh~~~~oh~~~~
its thinking about you
oh~~~~oh~~~~oh~~~~
counting on the days when we were together
when im million miles away
everywhere I go
im thinking about you
just want you to know
im thinking about you
New York or London
no matter where I been
the one thng that helps me get through
its thinking about you
oh~~~~oh~~~~oh~~~~
its thinking about you
oh~~~~oh~~~~oh~~~~
its thinking about you
oh~~~~oh~~~~oh~~~~
thinking about you
thinking about you
oh~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
