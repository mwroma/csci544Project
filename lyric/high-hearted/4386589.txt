i just wanna run
I just wanna run' hide it away
Run because they're chasing me down
I just wanna run' throw it away
Run before they’re finding me out
I just wanna run
I just wanna run
I'm out here all alone
I try to call your house
Can't reach you on the phone
I'll gather up the nerve
I'm packing up my bag
It's more than you deserve
Don't treat me like a drag
I'm feelin' like I keep on talking
I'm repeating myself' my words lost all meaning
I keep talking I repeat myself
I just wanna run' hide it away
Run because they're chasing me down
I just wanna run' throw it away
Run before they're finding me out
I just wanna run （run' run' run）
I just wanna run
（run' run' run）
Like a game of chess
I predict your move
I think I know you better
Better than you do
I'm sick of feeling cheap
Cheated and abused
Sick of losing sleep
Thinking about you
I'm feelin' like I keep on talking
I'm repeating myself' my words lost all meaning
I keep talking I repeat myself
I just wanna run' hide it away
Run because they're chasing me down
I just wanna run' throw it away
Run before they're finding me out
I just wanna run （run' run' run）
I just wanna run （run' run' run）
I just wanna run' hide it away
Run because they're chasing me down
I just wanna run' throw it away
Run before they're finding me out
I just wanna run' hide it away
Run because they're chasing me down
I just wanna run' throw it away
Run before they're finding me out
I just wanna run （run' run' run）
I just wanna run （run' run' run）
