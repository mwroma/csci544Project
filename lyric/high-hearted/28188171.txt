I said this time next year
I’m gonna be the one to do
Everything and more you said I couldn’t do
This one is for you
This time next year
I’m gonna be stronger
A little bit taller
Top is my only view
I'm kicking in the door now
Better get out of my way
Never really saw me coming
You left with nothing to say
This is for everybody
Who always put me down
I hope you open up your eyes
And take a good look at me now
Take a good look at me now
Take a good look at me now
Cause this time next year
I’m gonna walk down these halls
And show my face for the world to see
Gonna see me
And I’m gonna call every girl that turned me down
And tell them now that I’m just too busy
Cause I don’t have the time
And its funny how my so called friends
Who always left me alone
Suddenly running into me
And blowing up my phone
I'm kicking in the door now
Better get out of my way
Never really saw me coming
You left with nothing to say
This is for everybody
Who always put me down
I hope you open up your eyes
And take a good look at me now
Take a good look at me now
Take a good look at me now
Oh baby
Take a good look at me now
Take a good look at me now
Take a good look at me now
Oh look at me now
Oh this one is dedicated
To all of the people
Who said I would be nothing
Just look at me now
Look at me now
Look at me now
I'm kicking in the door now
Better get out of my way
Never really saw me coming
You left with nothing to say
This is for everybody
Who always put me down
I hope you open up your eyes
And take a good look at me now
Take a good look at me now
Take a good look at me now
Take a good look at me now
Take a good look at me now
