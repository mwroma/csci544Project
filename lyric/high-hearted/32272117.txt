(whistle)
I love you baby when you look at me
With your eyes rolling uncontrol me
I love you baby when you whisper those
That you love it when I wear his clothes
Just don't say
Just don't say
Just don't say you love me I won't say it back
I love you baby when you speak to me loud about somebody else unbear around
I love you baby when you say nine and me say up until a quarter past five
Just don't say
Just don't say
Just don't say you love me I won't say it back
Just don't say
Just don't say
Just don't say you love me I don't deserve that
You're all within my thoughts
So you always with me
Oh I am ok but I am not
Because we will never be you won't exist together daisy
You're all within my thoughts
So you always with me
Oh I am ok but I am not
Because we will never be you won't exist together daisy
Just don't say
Just don't say
Just don't say you love me I won't say it back
Just don't say
Just don't say
Just don't say you love me I don't deserve that
(whistle)
