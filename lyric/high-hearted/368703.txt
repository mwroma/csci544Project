Little harry
by莎士比亚书店
Twinkle Twinkle Little Star
How I wonder what you are
Up above the world so high
Like a diamond in the sky
Don't be sad
Don't be down
Keep a smile on your face
No matter what happensyou know I'll be there
The way you sing
The way you dance
Makes the world go ting-a-ling
Like a cherry on top of ice creams
And then one day you will grow up
Like a tough cookie you are
Don't let anyone bully the ones you love
And then one day you will grow up
Ride a rainbow to the stars
'Till the sunny smiles of yours light up the night
Twinkle Twinkle Little Star
How I wonder what you are
Up above the world so high
Like a diamond in the sky
Oh my baby my little Harry
Have a beautiful dream tonight
No matter what happens you know I'll be there
Oh my baby my little Harry
Have a beautiful dream tonight
You are a cherry on top of ice creams
