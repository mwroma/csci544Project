Took a while for me
I was blind but now I see
And I hope that you need me
Like I need you
When i'm thinking back to when
We took off it was all so easy then
All good things don't have to end
So trust in me
And you'll see
I'm ready for you
I'm ready to fly
I'm ready to jump off the edge of tonight
We'll go all the way
We'll never come down
I've made up my mind girl if you want me around
Never let our love burn out
Never let our love burn out
Never let go cuz baby it's cold without me to hold you
Never let our love burn out
Never let our love burn out
Don't push me away
It's never the same without me to hold you
You stay on my mind
Like a broken record all the time
Cuz I can't forget that night
You said to me
Let's run away
I'm ready for you
I'm ready to fly
I'm ready to jump off the edge of tonight
We'll go all the way
We'll never come down
I've made up my mind girl if you want me around
Never let our love burn out
Never let our love burn out
Never let go cuz baby it's cold without me to hold you
Never let our love burn out
Never let our love burn out
Don't push me away
It's never the same without me to hold you
Keep a candle in your window
So I can find my way
Back home
Never let our love burn out
Never let our love burn out
Never let go cuz baby it's cold without me to hold you
Never let our love burn out
Never let our love burn out
Don't push me away
It's never the same
Without me to hold you
To hold you
