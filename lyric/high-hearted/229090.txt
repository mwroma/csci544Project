A Little Love
 作曲  陈光荣
 作词  Anders Lee/冯曦妤
 Greatness as you
smallest as me
You show me
what is deep as sea

A little love
little kiss
A litlle hug
little gift
all of little something
these are our memories

You make me cry
make me smile
make me feel that love is true
You always stand by my side
I don't want to say goodbye
You make me cry

make me smile
make me feel
the joy of love
oh kissing you
Thank you for all the love
you always give to me
oh I love you
