Nina And Her Very Long Hair
I have a tale but not a tail
Like felius domesticum

It's of a girl a real girl
I'm calling by her real name

And thus began
A summer camp sonnet
She saw a boy who would soon be
A bee in her teenage bonnet
Nina and her very long hair
Held a torch that got her nowhere
She hit him with a thunderbolt smile
Every thing she had she threw
Every dress and every shoe
Nina and her very long hair
Held a torch that got her nowhere
As hard as she tried
He never looked twice
He never did see the light
And end the plight of Nina

Sometimes a film comes over me
Like a cold cup of tea
And I forget what I was set
To snag and bag grab and seize

At seventeen
She was still reeling
She went to camp
With a comb and a tent
And that same old feeling
Nina and her very long hair
Held a torch that got her nowhere
She hit him with a thunderbolt smile
Every thing she had she threw
Every dress and every shoe
Nina and her very long hair
Held a torch that got her nowhere
As hard as she tried
He never looked twice
He never did see the light
And end the plight of Nina

And so she snipped
She cut and she clipped
Enough to thatch a cottage roof
And once she'd preened
She glowed and she gleamed
Off she set to make him swoon

She was the girl with very short hair
That got her nowhere

End
