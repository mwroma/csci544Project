Guess it's true
I'm not good
At a one night stand
But I still need love
Cos I'm just a man
These nights never seem to go to plan
I don't want you to leave
Will you hold my hand
Oh won't you
Stay with me
Cos you're
All I need
This ain't love
It's clear to see
But darling
Stay with me
Why am I so emotional?
No it's not a good look
Gain some self control
Deep down I know this never works
But you can lay with me
So it doesn't hurt
Oh won't you
Stay with me
Cos you're
All I need
This ain't love
It's clear to see
But darling
Stay with me
Oh won't you
Stay with me
Cos you're
All I need
This ain't love
It's clear to see
But darling
Stay with me
Oh won't you
Stay with me
Cos you're
All I need
This ain't love
It's clear to see
But darling
Stay with me
