I told myself it was a riddle
that way I felt not in the middle
of a caravan east and a rattling tyre
I hurt my hand on those stinging nettles
and we couldn’t find where you put the kettle

When it burns on my feet and the window’s down
when it burns on the seat and we lie on the ground and say

and I’ll be selling it for another I’m done!

that way I felt not in the middle
of a caravan east and a rattling tyre
When it burns on my feet and the window’s down
when it burns on the seat and we lie on the ground
