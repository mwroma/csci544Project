I'm bringing sexy back
Them other boys don't know how to act
I think it's special
what's behind your back
So turn around and I'll pick up the slack
Take it to the bridge
Dirty babe
You see these shackles baby I'm your slave
I'll let you whip me' if I misbehave
It's just that no one makes me feel this way
Take it to the chorus
Come here girl / go head be gone with it
Come to the back
VIP drinks on me
Let me see what you're working with
Look at those hips
Make me smile
Go ahead childand get your sexy on
I'm bringing sexy back
Them other mother f***ers don't know how to act
Girl let me make up for the things you lack
Because you're burning up my body get it fast
Take it to the bridge
Dirty babe
You see these shackles baby I'm your slave
I'll let you whip me' if I misbehave
It's just that no one makes me feel this way
Take it to the chorus
Come here girl / go head be gone with it
Come to the back
VIP drinks on me
Let me see what you're working with
Look at those hips
Make me smile
Go ahead childand get your sexy on
Go' you ready （repeat） uh' yes

Because you'll burn it up for me and that's a fact
