I can't figure out
Is it meant to be this way
Easy words so hard to say
I can't live without
Knowing how you feel
Know if this is real
Tell me am I mistaken
Cause I don't have another heart for breakin'
Please don't let me go
I just wanna stay
Can't you feel my heartbeats
Giving me away
I just want to know
If you too feel afraid
I can feel your heartbeats
Giving you away
Giving us away
I can't understand
How it's making sense
That we put up such defense
When all you need to know
No matter what you do
I'm just as scared as you
Tell me am I mistaken
Cause I don't have another heart for breakin'
Please don't let me go
I just wanna stay
Can't you feel my heartbeats
Giving me away
I just want to know
If you too feel afraid
I can feel your heartbeats
Giving you away
Giving us away
Please don't let me go
I just wanna stay
Can't you feel my heartbeats
Giving me away
I just want to know
If you too feel afraid
I can feel your heartbeats
Giving you away
Giving us away
