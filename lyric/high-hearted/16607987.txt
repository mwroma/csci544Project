Trouble is a friend
 作曲  Lenka/Thomas Salter
 作词  Lenka/Thomas Salter
Trouble will find you no matter where you go oh oh
No matter if you're fast no matter if you're slow oh oh
The eye of the storm wanna cry in the morn oh oh

You're fine for a while but you start to lose control
He's there in the dark he's there in my heart
He waits in the wings he's gotta play a part
Trouble is a friend yeah trouble is a friend of mine
Ahh

Trouble is a friend but trouble is a foe oh oh

And no matter what I feed him he always seems to grow oh oh
He sees what I see and he knows what I know oh oh
So don't forget as you ease on down my road
He's there in the dark he's there in my heart
He waits in the wings he's gotta play a part
Trouble is a friend yeah trouble is a friend of mine
So don't be alarmed if he takes you by the arm
I roll down the window I'm a sucker for his charm
Trouble is a friend yeah trouble is a friend of mine
Ahh
How I hate the way he makes me feel
And how I try to make him leave
I try oh oh I try
He's there in the dark he's there in my heart
He waits in the wings he's gotta play a part
Trouble is a friend yeah trouble is a friend of mine
So don't be alarmed if he takes you by the arm
I roll down the window I'm a sucker for his charm
Trouble is a friend yeah trouble is a friend of mine
Ahh
Ooh
Ahh
Ooh
