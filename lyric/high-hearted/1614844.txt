Better With You
Wherever I go
Whatever I do
Stay by my side
Cuz baby it’s always better with you
In the middle of the pouring rain
On a crowded subway train
When I’m just about to go insane
You make it go away
Monday morning in a traffic jam
And I’m going to be late again
The world is getting underneath my skin
I see you smiling
And know that it’s going to be okay

Wherever I go
Whatever I do
Stay by my side
Cuz baby it’s always better with you
Girl when I’m alone
You’re where I belong
Cuz baby it’s always better with you
Oohhh Ohhh
Baby it’s always better with you

You make a bad day better than good
You make me feel better than I should
You understand when I’m misunderstood
Like no one else ever could
And girl you show me things I never see
If you were never there to see them with me
And when I get a little too crazy
You are my sanity
And everything will be okay

Wherever I go
Whatever I do
Stay by my side
Cuz baby it’s always better with you
Girl when I’m alone
You’re where I belong
Cuz baby it’s always better with you
Ooooh Ooooh
Baby its always better with you
Girl it doesn’t matter where we go
Cuz you always make it feel like it’s home
When I’m with youuu

Ooooh Ooooh Ooooh
Wherever I go
Whatever I do
Stay by my side
Cuz baby it’s always better with you
Girl When I’m alone
You’re where I belong
Cuz baby it’s always
Wherever I go
Whatever I do
Stay by my side
Cuz baby it’s always better with you
And when I’m alone
You’re where I belong
Cuz baby it’s always better
It’s always better with you
