Scouting For Girls - I Need A Holiday

It's a beautiful day but I'm stuck inside
Staring at this screen working -
How I hate this job coz the days do drag
They work me like a dog and the moneys bad
Cheer up cheer up don't be blue
Don't forget it's hometime soon
We'll make it through another working day

I need a holiday
I need a holiday with my friends
I'm working everyday
I'm working everyday for the weekend

Looking at my watch for the millionth time
The days go slow and then the evenings fly
When I'm outta this place and the days been won
I'm going out with my mates
I'm hanging out in the sun
Cheer up cheer up don't be blue
Don't forget it's hometime soon
We'll make it through another working day

I need a holiday
I need a holiday with my friends
I'm working everyday
I'm working everyday for the weekend

I wish it could be sunday when I wake up every day
I wish it could be sunday when I wake up every day
I wish it could be sunday when I wake up every day
I wish it could be sunday when I wake up every day
I wish it could be sunday when I wake up every day
I wish it could be sunday when I wake up every day
I wish it could be sunday when I wake up every day
I wish it could be sunday when I wake up every day

But I need you yeah I need you
Yeah I need you more than I can say
Yeah I need you yeah I need you
Yeah I need you more than I can say
More than I can say
Yeah I need you I need you I need you I need you
I need you more than a holiday
Yeah I need you I need you I n-n-n-n-need you
I need you more than I can say
More than I can say
