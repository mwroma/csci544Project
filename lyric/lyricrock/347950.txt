 Expiry night was prinked white
 you flowed away with a lullaby
 
 your spinning fire to answer another play
 that's my great location
 that's my great location
 how should I long to play
 that's my great location
 how should I long to play
 how far away it's to my second dream
 that's my great location
  that's my great location
  to be cool we have nothing to loose
 that's screaming horse's calling you
 oh it's calling you
  oh it's calling you
  that's my great location
  that's my great location
  that's my great location
 how should I long to play your Riff
