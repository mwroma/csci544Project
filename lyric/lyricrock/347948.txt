girl bye bye  don't give up the fight
girl bye bye you're turning your head
girl bye bye  don't give up the fight
girl bye bye  you're turning your head

turn the light off  get ready
to steal the city back under mother' eyes
never touch the shadow
don't you hear the radio
he said she's walking to the midnight and be shooting down the highway o-oh
so we can
you run above the sky
and searching for the red tree
you swim like fish through the night
until the birds sing
into the house  nothing destruction
into the house  nothing destruction
lalalalalalalalala
the summer for your closed magic
the summer for your closed magic
the summer for your closed magic
