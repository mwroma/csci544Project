指针空洞地旋转折断
机械的心脏独自紧张
北方的幽光 短暂明亮
水晶圣像 充满碰撞

Could you say?
It’s forever to move
And I wait
A chance of silent change
Could you sing now?
Did you sigh?

镜中景象勉强的伪装
从大气层的深处反光
北方的忧伤 孤芳自赏
消失乐章 神秘漫长

Could you say?
It’s forever to move
And I wait
A chance of silent change
Could you sing now?
Did you sigh?

This time for me
This time for you
This time for me
This time for you
Could you say?
It’s forever to move
And I wait
A chance of silent change
Could you sing now?
Did you sigh?
