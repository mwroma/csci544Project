Love  Is  Pop
love  is  pop
love  is  a  party
we  join  it  everyday
love  is  a  room
love  is  a  hotel
we  are  outside  every  night
we  have  a  fast  dream
we  have  got  a  terrible  life
we  have  a  horror  travel  in  it
when  you  leave  the  room
the  pink  elephant  comes
when  you  leave  the  car
the  rozd  comes  to  the  end
when  you  leave  the  bed
the  night  becomes  darkness
when  you  leave  the  room
the  light  comes  to  be  starduse
love  is  a  hit
love  is  a  drunk
we  dance  with  it  every  time
love  is  pop
love  is  a  hotel
we  are  outside  every  night
we  have  a  fast  dream
we  have  got  a  terrible  life
we  have  a  horror  travel  with  you
love  is  pop
love  is  a  party
love  is  a  room
love  is  a  hit
