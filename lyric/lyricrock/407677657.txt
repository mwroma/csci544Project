“Hey I feel so sad ”
My friend Daniel said
Oh really I thought you are a optimist
I looking up the grey sky
Something negative inside
Specially in fall
But it’s not your fault
People should make balance for themselves woo! Because they used to be happy
I told that to myself
Many many many times
So Daniel you alright

And you and you
Do you feel the same with us
And you
And you and you
Do you feel the same with us
