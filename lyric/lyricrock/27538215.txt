We're the new born man
with the real brain
We're the recently result
that human made
The flash of light
catch your mind
You can see us
the brand new human being
Look at my eyes
look at my eyes
You got it
you got it that what you want
You push it you push it
you push the switch
You won't defeat won't defeat
won't defeat us
won't defeat on your way
Because you all must die
We bring you all into the hole
We bring you all into the hole
