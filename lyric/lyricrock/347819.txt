The sun is scorching down
And the sand reflect its light
I'm moving with my shadow
Through this empty haunted land
Strange sounds from nowhere
And the strong wind cut my face
Nobody'll helpBut what else can I do ?
Oh! Lord I need your help                “
In the sky there's a eagle soaring by!
Oh Long way without friends
But I'll never never change my mind!
The moon is hanging high
With her lonely stars behind
The moonlinght lit the ground
The moonlight give me a chill
But only the moonlight will show me my way
Nobody'll helpBut what else can I do?
Oh! Lord I need your help                “
In the sky there's a eagle soaring by!
Oh Long way without friends
But I'll never never change my mind!
This gift is in my hands
And the road before my eyes
This fire has ceased to burn
I can feel the torture's gone
But will it last for long
When the spell is still around
Nobody careBut what else can I do?
Oh! Lord I need your help                “
In the sky there's a eagle soaring by!
Oh! Long way without friends
But I'll never never change my mind!
