 ah the poet jumps out of the window
 Like a falling bomb over my shoes
 There're  voices would be cutted off
 The newspaper reported it in the
 subway home
 In the subway
 It's a holiday
 It comes always so late
 The unknown mission makes the
 eyes insane
 When the plague were coming
 The emotion already to leave
 When the riot were coming
 So many brains start to think
What happen to me?
 Can you fell the breath
 It's from a beat under your skin
 It brings a wild sensation in 
 the tape-machine repeat the same
 word with different language
 the lonely face behind the freak with no pain
 Pretending nothing was wrong
 Pretending nothing was wrong
 Could you give me a chance again
 baby please!
 Don't you push me into the chaos
 aha!
 A new son of bitch is coming to the world today
 He's so smart like a cat and so cold like a snake today
 Pretending nothing was wrong
 Pretending nothing was wrong
