当我不用去上学
我要真正的男朋友
我从鼓楼走到Mao
还没有找到他
It's too late it's too late
我已赶不上地铁
It's time home it's time home
我不想回家睡觉
After party after party
after partyit's time home

结束热闹的舞会
来到下流的卡啦OK
我想和他去约会
可他有女朋友
It's too late it's too late
我已赶不上地铁
It\'s time home it's time home
我不想回家睡觉
After party after party
after partyit's time home

After party after party
after partyit's time home
After party after party
after partyit's time home
After party after party
after partyit's time home
