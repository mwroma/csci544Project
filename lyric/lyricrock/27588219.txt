Chasing waves by myself
in the ocean of endless sorrow
Making wishes that i will
find my herd tomorrow
 Hertz of heartbreak
 Hertz of heartache
Pacific deep is the loneliness that
drowned the child
(drowned the child)
Hey
Come along
Let's sing songs that no one'll ever understand
Blessing me I'll always be
Proud of what I am
Proud of what I am
