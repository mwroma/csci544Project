大厦
when i'm walking down the street
all the glass boxes round n' round
oh that's what i have to bear
super building catch the air
crazy traffic from east to west
i'll be in madness i don't care
never never shine on me
in the forest got no trees
oh that's what i have to hear
super building on my head
in the city i can't feel good
i'll be in madness i don't care
when i'm walking down the street
all the glass boxes round n' round
oh that's what i have to bear
super building catch the air
crazy traffic from east to west
i'll be in madness i don't care
