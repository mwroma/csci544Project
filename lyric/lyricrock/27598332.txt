Welcome back，you're listening to rebel radio！
This song is about the american dream！
With a freight old ship crashed new orleans
Hi~ho~siveri can't forget the cowboy song!
Honkytonk womanshe stole my heart
Bikini beach babyshe took my heart
I kept drivin' along down the gypsyroad
Radio radio
Rock all day and all of the night
Radio radio
Young blood！ you need some fun
Radio radio
Bring me back to the golden era
Radio radio
I make a holleri feel so good

She tell me she from the newyork city
I said，well girl，i'm from the mississippi
Honkytonk womanshe stole my heart
Bikini beach babyshe took my heart
I kept drivin' along down the gypsyroad
Radio radio
Rock all day and all of the night
Radio radio
Young blood！ you need some fun
Radio radio
Bring me back to the golden era
Radio radio
I make a holleri feel so good

Radio radio
Rock all day and all of the night
Radio radio
Young blood！ you need some fun
Radio radio
Bring me back to the golden era
Radio radio
I make a holleri feel so good
Radio radio
Radio radio
