Don't tell me that what I can't do
You've already let me down
Somebody tells me this is wrong
And waste time for nothing
I don't care about you
I know what I want
You'd better shut up and disappear
(let's go)
Please trust me
I will carry on
I've never regretted
And screaming for your heart
Please trust me
I will let you know
I don't want to lose more
The voices in the air

Reality is cruel and this I know
But it won't make me stay
I was dreaming something in nightmare and stick by my side
I don't care about you
I know what I want
You'd better shut up and disappear
Please trust me
I will carry on
I've never regretted
And screaming for your heart
Please trust me
I will let you know
I don't want to lose more
The voices in the air

Please trust me
I will carry on
I've never regretted
And screaming for your heart
Please trust me
I will let you know
I don't want to lose more
The voices in the air
Please trust me
I will carry on
I've never regretted
And screaming for your heart
Please trust me
I will let you know
I don't want to lose more
The voices in the air
The voices in the air
