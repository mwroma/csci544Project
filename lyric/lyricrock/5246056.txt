最后的胜利
Fighting with the dark
Searching for the light
My rage is the will of god
I am the arrow of revenge
Here we are to face the judging
Waiting for fantasy eyes
And the life is struggling us
Cruel and never be kind
Banners dancing in the wind
For her love for victory
Carry on brothers hold tight your sword
We are heading to the west
This rage is burning in
Offer strength to god of war
Slay the enemies fight till we die
If it's our destiny
Fighting with the dark
Searching for the light
My rage is the will of god
I am the arrow of revenge
Here we are to take the summoning
Choose to fight or choose to die
Destiny is calling us
Our faith will break the night
Banners dancing in the wind
For her love for victory
Carry on brothers hold tight your sword
We are heading to the west
Banners dancing in the wind
For her love for victory
Carry on brothers hold tight your sword
We are heading to the west
This rage is burning in
Offer strength to god of war
Slay the enemies fight till we die
If it's our destiny
Slay the enemies fight till we die
For the final victory
