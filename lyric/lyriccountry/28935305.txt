再见文汇路
If you are traveling to wehui road where
The sunshine is blue when wind is light
remember me to one who lives there for
she once was a true a true love of mine
Would you hold my hands my dear
if I saw you in the heaven of lost
how many youths are still dying there
the answer my friend is blowing
is blowing in the wind
If you are traveling back there again
within one yearor twoor never
remember to put on your red plaid shirt
and watch your footprints carvedburned on this road
If you are traveling to wenhui road where
The sunshine is blue when wind is light
tell her that i'll kiss her once again
with her long hair blowingblowing in the wind
再一次，再一次响起
再一次，再一次忘记
忘记我们我们
我们曾经在一起
想起我们我们
曾经在一起
我会再次吻她再次吻她
风中的长发
她的长发飘散在风里
然后继续
继续
再继续
找回忆
让我们继续
继续
再继续
找回忆
让我们继续
让我们继续
让我们继续
让我们继续
……
