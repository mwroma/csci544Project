You're always on my mind
All day just all the time
You're everything to me
Brightest star to let me see
You touch me in my dreams
We kiss in every scene
I pray to be with you
through rain and shiny days
I'll love you Till I die
Deep as sea Wide as sky
The beauty of our love paints rainbows
Everywhere we go
Need you all my life
You're my hope You're my pride
In your arms I find my heaven
In your eyes my sea and sky
May life be our love paradise
You're always on my mind
All day just all the time
You're everything to me
Brightest star to let me see
You touch me in my dreams
We kiss in every scene
I pray to be with you
through rain and shiny days
I'll love you Till I die
Deep as sea Wide as sky
The beauty of our love paints rainbows
Everywhere we go
Need you all my life
You're my hope You're my pride
In your arms I find my heaven
In your eyes my sea and sky
May life be our love paradise
I'll love you Till I die
Deep as sea Wide as sky
The beauty of our love paints rainbows
Everywhere we go
Need you all my life
You're my hope You're my pride
In your arms I find my heaven
In your eyes my sea and sky
May life be our love paradise
