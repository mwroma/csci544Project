My prayer
Dear God
I know that she's out there
the one i'm suppose to share my whole life with
And in time
you'll show her to me
Will you take care of her
comfort her
and protect her
until that day we meet
And let her know
my heart
is beating with hers
In a dream i hold you close
Embracing you with my hands
You gazed at me with eyes full of love
And made me understand
That i was meant to share it with you
My heart my mind my soul
Then i open my eyes
And all i see reality shows i'm alone
But i know someday that you'll be by my side
Cause i know god's just waiting till the time is right
God will you keep her safe from the thunderstorm
When the day's cold will you keep her warm
When the darkness falls
will you please shine her the way
God will you let her know that i love her so
When theres no one there that she's not alone
Just close her eyes and let her know
My heart is beating with hers
So i prayed until that day (prayed until that day)
When our hearts will beat as one
I will wait so patiently (patiently)
For that day to come (for that day to come)
I know someday that you'll be by my side
Cause i know god's just waiting till the time is right
God will you keep her safe from the thunderstorm
When the day's cold will you keep her warm
When the darkness falls
will you please shine her the way (shine he the way)
God will you let her know that i love her so
When theres no one there that she's not alone
Just close her eyes and let her know
My heart is beating with hers
Is beating with hers (ooo)
My heart is beating with hers (oooo)
It's beating with hers
God will you keep her safe from the thunderstorm
When the day's cold will you keep her warm
When the darkness falls
will you please shine her the way
God will you let her know that i love her so
When theres no one there that she's not alone
Just close her eyes and let her know
My heart is beating with hers
Oh
it's beating with hers
(it's beating with yours)
