sorry that i loved you
 作曲  Skot Suyama (陶山)
 作词  Skot Suyama (陶山)/倪安东
For all of the time that i tried for your smile
For making you think that i was worth the while
So your love love love love love would be mine
For sending you flowers and holding your hand
That no one was there to take a stand
But then love love love made us blind
And I'm so sorry that I hurt you
Sorry that I fell through
Sorry i was falling in love with you
I'm sorry that it came true
But sorry doesn't turn back time
For all that i have done to you
I wish that i could make it right
So sorry that i loved you
Sorry that i needed you
Sorry that i hold you tight
And I'm So sorry for
Making you love me and saying goodbye
For being the one that taught you how to cry
It was love love love and it passed us by
For giving you everything that you dreamed
For taking it back when i fled the scene
sorry lovefor wasting your time
And I'm so sorry that I hurt you
Sorry that I fell through
Sorry i was falling in love with you
I'm sorry that it came true
But sorry doesn't turn back time
For all that i have done to you
I wish that i could make it right
I'm so sorry that i loved you
Sorry that i needed you
Sorry that i hold you tight
And apology now after all of this time
Won't make my difference tonight
But I'm hoping I'm Sorry will open your mind
To love love love love in your life
Sorry that i hurt you
Sorry that i fell through
Sorry i was falling in love with you
I'm sorry that it came true
But sorry doesn't turn back time
For all that i have done to you
I wish that i could make it right
So sorry that i hurt you
Sorry that i fell through
Sorry i was falling in love with you
I'm sorry that it came true
But sorry do can't turn back time
I'm sorry that i loved you
I'm sorry that i hurt you
I'm so sorry that i loved you
I'm sorry that i hurt you
Sorry that i loved you
