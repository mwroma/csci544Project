CHOCOLATEICE
by南大狗不上六百分不改名
Bring me to the sea of sugar and spice
Reminiscing through some chocolate ice
Tik tok take time to be gentle and kind
You sweat cause you run and run all day in my mind
Fly to the moon and the sun
And let's go have fun
Come and take my hand and free our soul again
Fly to the moon and the sun
And let's go have fun
It's  my love is plain to see
What I do for you baby do for me
Let me serenade your soul
When you're feeling down and low
Let the music come alive
Let tenderness arrive
Let me serenade your soul
When you're feeling down and low
Boy you make me feel so high
Together we can fly

Bring me to the sea of sugar and spice
Reminiscing through some chocolate ice
Tik tok take time to be gentle and kind
You sweat cause you run and run all day in my mind
Fly to the moon and the sun
And let's go have fun
Come and take my hand and free our soul again
Fly to the moon and the sun
And let's go have fun
It's  my love is plain to see
What I do for you baby do for me
Let me serenade your soul
When you're feeling down and low
Let the music come alive
Let tenderness arrive
Let me serenade your soul
When you're feeling down and low
Boy you make me feel so high
Together we can fly
