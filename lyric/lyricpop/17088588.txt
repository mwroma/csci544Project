Daddy DJ please take me to the party
And let me dance along until the lights are on
Daddy DJ please take me to the party
And let the music play until the break of day
Another night like a million before
Another party where I’m not invited
As always you’ll heat the dance floor
In front of your turntables going mad
Why don’t you keep me close to you
I’m not anymore the kid you knew
Why should I stay deep in the blue
I wanna move my body too
