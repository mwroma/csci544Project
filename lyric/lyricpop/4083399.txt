I am loving living every single day but sometimes I feel so
I hope to find a little peace of mind and I just want to know
And who can heal those tiny broken hearts and what are we to be
Where is home on the Milky way of stars I dry my eyes again
In my dreams I am not so far away from home
What am I in a world so far away from home
All my life all the time so far away from home
Without you I will be so far away from home
If we could make it through the darkest night we have a brighter day
The world I see beyond your pretty eyes
makes me want to stay
And who can heal those tiny broken hearts
and what are we to be
Where is home on the Milky way of stars
I dry my eyes again
In my dreams I am not so far away from home
What am I in a world so far away from home
All my life all the time so far away from home
Without you I will be so far away from home
I count on you no matter what they say
cause love can find it time
I hope to be a part of you again
baby let us shine
And who can heal those tiny broken hearts
and what are we to be
Where is home on the Milky way of stars
I dry my eyes again
In my dreams I am not so far away from home
What am I in a world so far away from home
All my life all the time so far away from home
Without you I will be so far away from home
In my dreams I am not so far away from home
What am I in a world so far away from home
All my life all the time so far away from home
Without you I will be so far away from home
