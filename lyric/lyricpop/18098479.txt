Faraway From Home
I'm loving living every single day
but sometimes I feel so
I hope to find a little peace of mind
and I just want to know
And who can heal those tiny broken hearts
and what are we to be
Where is home on the milkyway of stars
I dry my eyes again
In my dreams I'm not so far away from home
What am I in a world so far away from home
All my life all the time so far away from home
without you I'll be so far away from home
If we could make it thrue the darkest Night
we'd have a brither day
the world I see beyond your pretty eyes
makes me want to stay
And who can heal those tiny broken hearts
and what are we to be
Where is home on the milkyway of stars
I dry my eyes again
In my dreams I'm not so far away from home
What am I in a world so far away from home
All my life all the time so far away from home
without you I'll be so far away from home
I count on you no matter what they say
cause love can find it's time
I hope to be a part of you again
baby let us shine
And who can heal those tiny broken hearts
and what are we to be
Where is home on the milkyway of stars
I dry my eyes again
In my dreams I'm not so far away from home
What am I in a world so far away from home
All my life all the time so far away from home
without you I'll be so far away from home
In my dreams I'm not so far away from home
What am I in a world so far away from home
All my life all the time so far away from home
without you I'll be so far away from home
