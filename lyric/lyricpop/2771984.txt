Half way up your smile going down
but I'm getting stronger and stronger
Half way up your smile going down
but I'm getting stronger and stronger
I get my Inside out and my headache won't stop
I fail to not look back
as I'm bouncing down the wrong track
Half way up your smile going down
but I’m getting stronger and stronger
Once Again I'm longing for your hungry touch
Picture when you on me I'm missing you so much
You turn on light imagination goal your follow way
And in my fantasy you came my body;
I need you back to stay
I get my Inside out and my headache won't stop
I fail to not look back
as I'm bouncing down the wrong track
Half way up your smile going down
but I’m getting stronger and stronger
Uhoo Uhooo (uhoo uhoo)
But I'm getting stronger and stronger
Uhoo Uhooo (uhoo uhoo)
But I'm getting stronger and stronger
Midnight turns to morning I don't get lot sleep
I know that you are out there somewhere
being someone else's treat
Have think us knows just how to please me
Chance run down my spying
And when you wake up spill your kisses
I am shivering inside it
I get my Inside out and my headache won't stop
I fail to not look back
as I’m bouncing down the wrong track
Half way up your smile going down
but I'm getting stronger and stronger
Uhoo Uhooo (uhoo uhoo)
But I'm getting stronger and stronger
Uhoo Uhooo (uhoo uhoo)
But I'm getting stronger and stronger
Uhoo Uhooo (uhoo uhoo)
But I'm getting stronger and stronger
Uhoo Uhooo (uhoo uhoo)
But I'm getting stronger and stronger
I get my Inside out and my headache won't stop
I fail to not look back
as I'm bouncing down the wrong track
Half way up your smile going down
but I'm getting stronger and stronger
I get my Inside out and my headache won't stop
I fail to not look back
as I'm bouncing down the wrong track
Half way up your smile going down
but I'm getting stronger and stronger
Uhoo Uhooo (uhoo uhoo)
But I'm getting stronger and stronger
Uhoo Uhooo (uhoo uhoo)
But I'm getting stronger and stronger
