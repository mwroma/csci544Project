Hello Mr DJ'
Would you play my song
Please' please' play it
All night long
Hello Mr DJ

Calling every station
On the air
Sending out the message
Everywhere
Tell it everybody
On the radio

Everybody' everywhere
Please call the DJ on the air
From Moon to Mars and everywhere
Please call the DJ on the air
Hello Mr DJ I'm losing sleep
Please' please' play it
My knees are gettin' weak
Hello Mr DJ
On the radio
If you're not gonna play it
I go insane
If you're not say it
I lose my brain
So tell it everybody
On the radio
Oh' oh' oh
Everybody' everywhere
Please call the DJ on the air
From Moon to Mars and everywhere
Please call the DJ on the air
Everybody' everywhere
Please call the DJ on the air
From Moon to Mars and everywhere
Please call the DJ on the air
