remembering me
discover and see
all over the world
she's known as a girl
to those who a free
the mind shall be key
forgotten as the past
'cause history will last
god is a girl
wherever you are
do you believe it can you recieve it
god is a girl
whatever you say
do you believe it can you recieve it
god is a girl
however you live
do you believe it can you recieve it
god is a girl
she's only a girl
do you believe it can you recieve it

she wants to shine
forever in time
she is so driven she's always mine
cleanly and free
she wants you to be
a part of the future
a girl like me
there is a sky illuminating us
someone is out there that we truly trust
there is a rainbow for you and me
a beautiful sunrise eternally
god is a girl
wherever you are
do you believe it can you recieve it
god is a girl
whatever you say
do you believe it can you recieve it
god is a girl
however you live
do you believe it can you recieve it
god is a girl
she's only a girl
do you believe it can you recieve it
god is a girl
wherever you are
do you believe it can you recieve it
god is a girl
whatever you say
do you believe it can you recieve it
god is a girl
however you live
do you believe it can you recieve it
god is a girl
she's only a girl
do you believe it can you recieve it
god is a girl
