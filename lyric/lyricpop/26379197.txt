firefly
When I said go I never meant away
You ought to know the freaky games we play
Could you forgive and learn how to forget
Hear me as I'm calling out your name
Fire fly come back to me
Make the night as bring as day
I'll be looking out for you
Tell me that your lonely too
Fire fly come lead me on
Follow you into the sun
That's the way it ought to be
Fire fly come back to me
You and me
We shared a mistery
We were so close
Like honey to the bee
And if you tell me how to make you understand
I'm minor in a major kind a way
Fire fly come back to me
Make the night as bring as day
I'll be looking out for you
Tell me that your lonely too
Fire fly come lead me on
Follow you into the sun
That's the way it ought to be
Fire fly come back to me
Fly fire fly through the sky
Come and play with my desire
Don't be longdon't ask why
I can't wait another night
Fly fire fly through the sky
Wait another night
Don't be long
Firefly
Fire fly come back to me
Make the night as bring as day
I'll be looking out for you
Tell me that your lonely too
Fire fly come lead me on
Follow you into the sun
That's the way it ought to be
Firefly come back
Fire fly come back to me
Make the night as bring as day
I'll be looking out for you
Tell me that your lonely too
Fire fly come lead me on
Follow you into the sun
That's the way it ought to be
Fire fly come back to me
