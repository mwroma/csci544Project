Walking in the Sun in around and around
I can believe love at is around
Walking in the Sun in around and around and around
walking in the Sun in around and around and around
And the lander or chorer check to want a stair
How too fun the better place
Every boys and girls are looking for a chance
And the music starts to play
wowGet to be this way
wowYou are one for me
Walking in the Sun in around and around
I can believe love at is around
Walking in the Sun in around and around and around
Look at try for me
Walking in the Sun in around and around
Walking in the Sun in around and around
Walking in the Sun in around and around and around
With two changes together body in the sex
bady you need tell know me
Every boys and girls are looking for a manner
To remember everyday
wowGet to be this way
wowYou are one for me
Walking in the Sun in around and around and around
I can believe love at is around
Walking in the Sun in around and around and around
Look at try for me
Walking in the Sun in around and around
Walking in the Sun in around and around
Walking in the Sun in around and around
Walking in the Sun in around and around and around
