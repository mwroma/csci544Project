Ohh whooaa
Ohh whooaa
Ohh whooaa

You know you love me
I know you care
Just shout whenever
And I'll be there
You are my love
You are my heart
And we would never ever ever be apart

Are we an item?
Girl quit playin'
We're just friends
What are you sayin'
Said there's another look right in my eyes
My first love broke my heart for the first time

And I was like
Baby baby baby ohh
Like
Baby baby baby noo
Like
Baby baby baby ohh
I thought you'd always be mine (mine)
Baby baby baby ohh
Like
Baby baby baby noo
Like
Baby baby baby ohh
I thought you'd always be mine (mine)

Oh for you I would've done whatever
And I just can't believe we ain't together
And I wanna play it cool
But I'm losing you
I'll buy you anything
I'll buy you any ring
And I'm in pieces
Baby fix me
Just shake me till you wake me from this bad dream
I'm goin down down down down
And I just can't believe my first love won't be around

And I was like
Baby baby baby ohh
Like
Baby baby baby noo
Like
Baby baby baby ohh
I thought you'd always be mine (mine)
Baby baby baby ohh
Like
Baby baby baby noo
Like
Baby baby baby ohh
I thought you'd always be mine (mine)

Luda!
When i was 
I had my first love
There was nobody that could compare to my baby
And nobody came between us
Noone could ever come above
She had me going crazy
Oh i was starstruck
She woke me up daily
Dont need no starbucks
She made my heart pound
And skip a beat when i see her in the streets and
Andat school on the playground
But i really wanna see her on the weekend
She knows she got me dazing
Cause she was so amazing
And now my heart is breaking
But i just keep on saying

Baby baby baby ohh
Baby baby baby noo
Like
Like
Baby baby baby ohh
I thought you'd always be mine (mine)
Baby baby baby ohh
Like
Baby baby baby noo
Baby baby baby ohh
Like
I thought you'd always be mine (mine)

Yeahh yeah yeah

Yeahh yeah yeah
Now I'm all gone gone gone gone I'm gone
