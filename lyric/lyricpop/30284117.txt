tiSet Fire To The Love Song
I let it fall my heart
And as it fell you rose to claim it
It was dark and I was over
Until you kissed my lips and you saved me
My hands they were strong but my knees were far too weak
To stand in your arms without falling to your feet
But there's a side to you that I never knew never knew
All the things you'd say they were never true never true
And the games you'd play you would always win always win
But I set fire to the rain
Watched it pour as I touched your face
Well it burned while I cried
'Cause I heard it screaming out your name your name
I set fire to the rain
And I threw us into the flames
When we fell something died
'Cause I knew that that was the last time the last time
Cursing me boy you played through my mind like a symphony
There's no way to describe what you do to me
You just do to me what you do
And it feels like I've been rescued
I've been set free
I am hyptonized by your destiny
You are magicallyricalbeautiful
You are and I want you to know baby
I I love you like a love song baby
I I love you like a love song baby
I I love you like a love song baby
And I keep it in re-pe-pe-peat
I set fire to the rain
And I threw us into the flames
When we fell something died
'Cause I knew that that was the last time the last time
Sometimes I wake up (No one can pause)by the door
(You stand alone to every record I own)
That heart you caught must be waiting for you
Even now when we're already over(Music to my hear )
I can't help myself from looking for you(that's what you are a song that goes on and on)
I set fire to the rain(I I love you like a love song baby)
Watched it pour as I touch your face(I I love you like a love song baby)
Well it burned while I cried(I I love you like a love song baby)
'Cause I heard it screaming out your name your name(And I keep it in re-pe-pe-peat)
Let it burn(I I love you like a love song baby)
ohI I love you like a love song baby
babyI I love you like a love song baby
And I keep it in re-pe-pe-peat
