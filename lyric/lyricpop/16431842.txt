Innocence
 作词  LAVIGNE AVRIL/TAUBENFELD EVAN
Waking up I see that everything is ok
The first time in my life and now it's so great
Slowing down I look around and I am so amazed
I think about the little things that make life great
I wouldn't change a thing about it
This is the best feeling
This innocence is brilliant
I hope that it will stay
This moment is perfect
please don't go away
I need you now
And I'll hold on to it
don't you let it pass you by
I found a place so safe not a single tear
The first time in my life and now it's so clear
Feel calm I belong I'm so happy here
It's so strong and now I let myself be sincere
I wouldn't change a thing about it
This is the best feeling
This innocence is brilliant
I hope that it will stay
This moment is perfect
please don't go away
I need you now
And I'll hold on to it
don't you let it pass you by
It's the state of bliss you think you're dreaming
It's the happiness inside that you're feeling
It's so beautifulit makes you wanna cry
It's the state of bliss you think you're dreaming
It's the happiness inside that you're feeling
It's so beautifulit makes you wanna cry
It's so beautifulit makes you want to cry
This innocence is brilliant
it makes you want to cry
This innocence is brilliance
please don't go away
Cause I need you now
And I'll hold on to it
don't you let it pass you by
This innocence is brilliant
I hope that it will stay
This moment is perfect
please don't go away
I need you now
And I'll hold on to it
don't you let it pass you by
