Burning
Passion is sweet
Love makes weak
You said you cherished freedom
so You refuse to let it go
Follow your fate
Love and hate
Never fail to seize the day
don't give yourself away 
Oh when the night falls
And your all alone
In your deepest sleep
what Are you dreaming of
My skin's still burning from your touch
Oh I just can't get enough
I Said I wouldn't ask for much
But your eyes are dangerous
So the thought keeps spinning in my head
Can we drop this masquerade
I can't predict where it ends
If your the rock I'll crush against
Trapped in a crowd
The music is loud
I said I love my freedom too
Now I'm not so sure I do
All eyes on you
wings so true
Better quit while you're ahead
Now I'm not so sure I am
Oh when the night falls
And your are alone
In your deepest sleep
what are you dreaming of
My skin's still burning from your touch
Oh I just can't get enough
Said I wouldn't ask for much
But your eyes are dangerous
so the thought keep spinning in my head
Can we drop this masquerade
I can't predict where it ends
If your the rock I'll crush against
My soul my heart
If you're near or if you're far
My life my love
You can have it alloohyeahho ah
Oh when the night falls
And your are alone
In your deepest sleep
what are you dreaming of
My skin's still burning from your touch
Oh I just can't get enough
Said I wouldn't ask for much
But your eyes are dangerous
so the thought keep spinning in my head
Can we drop this masquerade
I can't predict where it ends
If your the rock I'll crush against
ooh if your the rock I'll crush against
