bye
 作词  A Cheope Galbiati K Pausini 
now what if i never kiss your lips again
or feel the touch of your sweet embrace
how would i ever go on?
without you there's no place to belong
well someday love is going to lead you back to me
but till it does i'll have an empty heart
so i'll just have to believe
somewhere out there you're thinking of me
until the day i let you go
until we say our next hello
it's not goodbye
till i see you again
i'll be right here remembering when
and if time is on our side
there will be no tears to cry on down the road
there is one thing i can't deny
it's not goodbye
you'd think i'd be strong enough to make it trough
and rise above when the rain falls down
but its so hard to be strong
when you've been missing somebody so long
it's just a matter of time i'm sure
but time takes time and i can' t hold on
so won't you try as hard as you can
to put my broken heart together again
and i can't deny
till i see you
goodbye
