loves me not
I complicated our lives
By falling in love with him
I complicated our lives
Now I'm losing my only friend
I don't know why I had to try
Living my life on the other side
Now I'm so confused
I don't know what to do
He loves me He loves me not
She loves me She loves me not
He loves me He loves me not
She loves me
I started blurring the lines
Because I didnâ€™t care
I started crossing the line
Cause you were never there
No where to turnNo one to help
It's almost like I don't even know myself
Now I have to choose
I don't know what to do
He loves me He loves me not
She loves me She loves me not
He loves me He loves me not
She loves me she loves me
She loves me

He loves me He loves me not
She loves me She loves me not
He loves me He loves me not
She loves me
No where to turnNo one to help
It's almost like I don't even know myself
Now I have to choose
I don't know what to do
He loves me He loves me not
She loves me She loves me not
He loves me He loves me not
She loves me She loves me not
He loves me He loves me not
She loves me She loves me not
He loves me He loves me not
She loves me She loves me not
he loves me not
