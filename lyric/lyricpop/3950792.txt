as long as you love me
Although loneliness has always been a friend of mine
I'm leaving my life in your hands
People say I'm crazy that I am blind
Risking it all in a glance
How you got my blind is still a mystery
I can't get you out of my head
Don't care what is written in your history
As long as you're here with me
I don't care who you are
Where you're from
What you did
As long as you love me
Who you are
Where you're from
Don't care what you did
As long as you love me
Every little thing that you have said and done
Feels like it's deep within me
Doesn't really matter if you're on the run
It seems like were meant to be
I don't care who you are
Where you're from
What you did
As long as you love me
Who you are
Where you're from
Don't care what you did
As long as you love me
As long as you love me
I've tried to hide it so that no one knows
But I guess it shows
When you look in to my eyes
What you did and where you're coming from
I don't care as long as you love me baby
I don't care who you are
Where you're from
What you did
As long as you love me
Who you are
Where you're from
Don't care what you did
As long as you love me
Who you are
Where you're from
What you did
As long as you love me
Who you are
Where you're from
As long as you love me
Who you are
As long as you love me
What you did
I don't care as long as you love me
