my love

An empty street
An empty house
A hole inside my heart
I'm all alone
The rooms are getting smaller
I wonder how
I wonder why
I wonder where they are
The days we had
The songs we sang together
Oh yeah
And oh my love
I'm holding on forever
Reaching for a love that seems so far
So I say a little prayer
And hope my dreams will take me there
Where the skies are blue to see you once again my love
Over seas and coast to coast
To find a place I love the most
Where the fields are green to see you once again my love
I try to read
I go to work
I'm laughing with my friends
But I can't stop to keep myself from thinking Oh no
I wonder how
I wonder why
I wonder where they are
The days we had
The songs we sang together Oh yeah
And oh my love
I'm holding on forever
Reaching for a love that seems so far
So I say a little prayer
And hope my dreams will take me there
Where the skies are blue to see you once again my love
Over seas and coast to coast
To find a place I love the most
Where the fields are green to see you once again
To hold you in my arms
To promise you my love
To tell you from the heart
You're all I'm thinking of
I'm reaching for a love that seems so far
So I say a little prayer
And hope my dreams will take me there
Where the skies are blue to see you once again my love
Over seas and coast to coast
To find a place I love the most
Where the fields are green to see you once again my love
Say a little prayer
I dreams will take me there
Where the skies are blue to see you once again
Over seas and coast to coast
To find a place I love the most
Where the fields are green to see you once again
My love
